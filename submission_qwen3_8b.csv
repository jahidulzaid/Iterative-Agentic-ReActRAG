Niamey City - Fortune of Africa Niger
Niamey City
Location
Niamey is the capital and largest city of the West African country Niger. Niamey lies on the Niger River, primarily situated on the east bank. It is an administrative, cultural and economic centre.
The city is located in a pearl millet growing region, while manufacturing industries include bricks, ceramic goods, cement and weaving.
History of the City
Niamey was founded in the e18th century, but was of little importance to most of the country until the French developed a colonial post in the 1890s. This rapidly grew into an important centre.
In 1926 it became the capital of Niger and the population gradually increased, from about 3,000 in 1930 to around 30,000 in 1960. The period from 1970 to 1988 was one in which the economy of Niger boomed, driven by revenue from the uranium mines at Arlit.

Zinder
Much of Niger is taken up by desert or semi-desert, with ancient cities  such as Agadez and Zinder acting as trading centres for the caravan  trains which crossed this dry region. Today, tourists join expeditions  to see some of Niger’s spectacular scenery, such as the landscapes of  the Ténéré Desert and Aïr Mountains.

Zinder
Founded in the 18th century, Zinder became famous for its city wall, which was built to protect the inhabitants from slave traders. When the French took over the region – see History & Politics – it became the capital of the French colony until eclipsed by Niamey. The city contains fine examples of Hausa clay buildings and visitor attractions include the Great Mosque and the 19th century Sultan’s palace, where the Sultan of Zinder still lives.

Aïr Mountains
The Aïr Mountains (also known as the Aïr Massif) lie within the Sahara desert. Because of their greater altitude (they rise to over 1,800 metres), temperatures in this region are cooler. The mountains harbour dry river valleys (known as wadis) which channel water to pools or oases, creating areas where some farming activities can take place. Rock art from Neolithic times shows the area has long been inhabited by man.
Development
‘People are the real wealth of a nation.’ This is the belief of the United Nations, whose Millenium Development Goals provide a framework for improving the lives of millions.
It helps when nations are peaceful, stable and growing economically. But where even the poorest countries focus on health, education and creating fairer societies, more Africans have the chance of a better life.
Children
Around one in six children born in sub-Saharan Africa don't live to see their fifth birthday and life can be tough for those who do.
What are the common challenges facing African children and how do their lives compare with those of children in the UK?
Ingal
West of Agadez, Ingal is most famous as the meeting place for many nomadic peoples, such as the Tuareg and Fulani, many of whom come together for the annual Cure Salée festival in September. This is the time when Tuareg camel-breeders and Wodaabe cattle-herders bring their animals at the end of the rains for a celebration – see Festivals. At other times of the year, it is the place to stay with Tuareg and Fulani people. The area also boasts some of Niger’s Neolithic rock engravings.

Did the Sun Stand Still?
by 
Brad Bromling, D.Min.
Q.
How can I believe the Bible is reliable when it says that the Sun “stood still” at the request of Joshua?
A.
This question relates to the history narrated in Joshua 10. After the defeat of Ai, five kings of Canaan joined forces to attack the city of Gibeon for making an alliance with Israel. Upon hearing of this move, Joshua and his men marched through the night from Gilgal to Gibeon where, with the Lord's help, Israel waged war. In the midst of battle, Joshua prayed to God that the Sun would stand still until Israel could vanquish her enemy. This request was granted, as the record states: “So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day. And there has been no day like that, before it or after it, that the Lord heeded the voice of man, for the Lord fought for Israel” (Joshua 10:13-14).
Critics insist that such an event is impossible, and thereby impugn the veracity of the Scriptures. Various solutions to this alleged problem have been proposed. This article will consider four of them. First, some suggest that the text should be understood in a figurative sense and that the event did not involve a miracle. Hence, it is suggested that the Lord helped Israel win the battle in such an incredibly short time that she felt as though the day had been lengthened, when in fact it was not (Keil, 1980, 2:110). Second, some scholars take the language figuratively and attach a purely naturalistic explanation to the event. Donald Patten and his colleagues believe that the planet Mars passed by Earth in an unusually close orbit that caused the Earth to tilt on its axis (1973, pp. 172-198). Viewed from the right geographical location, the Sun actually would hang in the sky longer than normal. Third, others suggest that a local miracle took place. Hence, the Sun’s rays may have been refracted miraculously so that they gave every appearance of daylight-illumination in Palestine, when in reality the Sun had slipped below the horizon (Davis, 1980, p. 69). Fourth, still others take the language literally and accept that the Sun was indeed halted miraculously. Henry Morris explains that even more may have been involved: “Since the account says that the moon also stood still (Joshua 10:13), it may be that the entire solar system stopped in its tracks for a day, with all relative positions and motions simply suspended” (1971, p. 73).
Each of these solutions has met with criticism. Against the first it has been contended that a cardinal rule of interpretation is that a passage is to be considered literal until proven figurative. Joshua 10 reads like simple, historical narration. The Lord could have made the day “seem” long, but the text says that “the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the people had revenge upon their enemies” (Joshua 10:13). The second has been challenged for lack of evidence. The notion that the Earth shifted on its axis in response to a fly-by of Mars is purely hypothetical. The third option is rejected out-of-hand by anyone who refuses to accept the possibility of miraculous occurrences. Against the literal reading, it is argued that since the Earth orbits the Sun, it would have been the Earth that ceased to rotate, rather than the Sun stopping, that lengthened the day. Also, if the Earth stopped it would experience incalculable global catastrophes.
[...]","The context explicitly mentions that Joshua prayed to the Lord for the sun and moon to stand still, as recorded in Joshua 10:12-13. The answer is directly stated in the passage where Joshua commands the sun to stand still over Gibeon and the moon over the Valley of Ajalon. The context also includes various interpretations and discussions, but the explicit answer is that the sun and moon stood still before Joshua.",145,1,1,1,1,1

Birthplace:
Brooklyn, New York
The son of a Brooklyn policeman who died when he was eight, African-American comedy superstar Eddie Murphy was raised in the comfortable middle-class community of Hempstead, NY, by his mother and stepfather. A natural-born class clown, he was voted the most popular student at Roosevelt Junior and Senior High. By the age of 15, he was doing standup gigs at 25 to 50 dollars a pop, and within a few years he was headlining on the comedy-club circuit.
Murphy was 19 he was when hired as one of the backup performers on the NBC comedy weekly Saturday Night Live. His unique blend of youthful arrogance, sharkish good cheer, underlying rage, and street-smart versatility transformed the comedian into SNL's prime attraction, and soon the country was reverberating with imitations of such choice Murphy characterizations as sourball celebrity Gumby, inner-city kiddie host Mr. Robinson, prison poet Tyrone Green, and the Little Rascals' Buckwheat. Just when it seemed that he couldn't get any more popular, Murphy was hastily added to the cast of Walter Hill's 1982 comedy/melodrama feature film 48 Hours, and voila, an eight-million-dollars-per-picture movie star was born. The actor followed this cinematic triumph with John Landis' Trading Places, a Prince and the Pauper update released during the summer of 1983, the same year that the standup album Eddie Murphy, Comedian won a Grammy. In 1984, he finally had the chance to carry a picture himself: Beverly Hills Cop, one of the most successful pictures of the decade. Proving that at this juncture Murphy could do no wrong, his next starring vehicle, The Golden Child (1986), made a fortune at the box office, despite the fact that the picture itself was less than perfect. After Beverly Hills Cop 2 and his live standup video Eddie Murphy Raw (both 1987), Murphy's popularity and career seemed to be in decline, though his staunchest fans refused to desert him. His esteem rose in the eyes of many with his next project, Coming to America (1987), a reunion with John Landis that allowed him to play an abundance of characters -- some of which he essayed so well that he was utterly unrecognizable.
Murphy bowed as a director, producer, and screenwriter with Harlem Nights (1989), a farce about 1930s black gangsters which had an incredible cast (including Murphy, Richard Pryor, Della Reese, Redd Foxx, Danny Aiello, Jasmine Guy, and Arsenio Hall), but was somewhat destroyed by Murphy's lazy, expletive-ridden script and clichéd plot that felt recycled from Damon Runyon stories. Churned out for Paramount, the picture did hefty box office (in the 60-million-dollar range) despite devastating reviews and reports of audience walkouts. Murphy's box-office triumphs continued into the '90s with a seemingly endless string of blockbusters, such as the Reginald Hudlin-directed political satire The Distinguished Gentleman (1992), that same year's ""player"" comedy Boomerang, and the Landis-directed Beverly Hills Cop III (1994). After an onscreen absence of two years following Cop, Murphy reemerged with a 1996 remake of Jerry Lewis' The Nutty Professor. As directed by Tom Shadyac and produced by the do-no-wrong Brian Grazer, the picture casts Murphy as Dr. Sherman Klump, an obese, klutzy scientist who transforms himself into Buddy Love, a self-obsessed narcissist and a hit with women. As an added surprise, Murphy doubles up his roles as Sherman and Buddy by playing each member of the Klump family (beneath piles and piles of latex). The Nutty Professor grossed dollar one and topped all of Murphy's prior efforts, earning well up into the hundreds of millions and pointing the actor in a more family-friendly direction. His next couple of features, Dr. Dolittle and the animated Mulan (both 1998), were children-oriented affairs, although in 1999 he returned to more mature material with the comedies Life (which he also produced) and Bowfinger; and The PJs, a fairly bawdy claymation sitcom about life in Sout

The Shining Path began in the late 1960s as a small communist revolutionary group led by a philosophy professor named Abimael Guzmán. Guzmán opposed Peru's prevailing political elites. His followers drew on Marxism and the example of Cuba's Fidel Castro, and coalesced into a significant and violent guerrilla army which regularly used terrorist tactics in their effort to destabilize and overthrow the Peruvian government. At the height of its power, Shining Path's ranks numbered around ten thousand, according to a report from the Jamestown Foundation . A paper from the Council on Hemispheric Affairs (COHA) says the main goal of Shining Path has always been to overthrow the existing Peruvian government and political institutions and replace them with a communist revolutionary command. Guzmán, adopting the nom de guerre Presidente Gonzalo, attempted to do all of this while resisting overt ties with foreign powers or other Latin American leftist groups, including the contemporary Peruvian group known as the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. ...","The context explicitly mentions that the Shining Path is a terrorist organization in Peru, with operations in regions like Ayacucho, Apurímac, and Huancavelica, as well as urban areas like Lima.

'Red wine could have led to Jimi Hendrix's death', says close friend Meic Stevens | Daily Mail Online 'Red wine could have led to Jimi Hendrix's death', says close friend Meic Stevens comments 'Jimi Hendrix didn't know how to drink red wine', says close friend Meic Stevens The doctor who attempted to save Jimi Hendrix on the night that the guitarist died said it was 'plausible' he was murdered because he 'drowned in red wine'. But the iconic musician may have choked and died because he did not know how to drink the substance, close friend Meic Stevens has revealed. Speaking publicly for the first time about the night leading to Hendrix's death, the singer-songwriter said the star was mixing red wine with lager and drinking the concoction from a pint glass. He said: ‘I was with Jimi Hendrix the night he died. He had been drinking red wine with me - even though he had never drunk red wine in his life before. The 69-year-old claimed he and Hendrix had been having a night out with Marmalade stars Gary Farr and Jimmy Cregan, as well as Eric Clapton, at the infamous Scotch of St James bar in Mayfair. In an interview for Radio 4 documentary Free Wales Harmony, Mr Stevens claimed Hendrix was intrigued that he was drinking Louis St George Burgundy and wanted to try it. He added: ‘[Hendrix] was drinking lager or some kind of beer and he just poured the wine in to the pint glass. I don’t think he had ever drunk red wine before – he didn’t know how to drink it. ‘But he seemed okay. He seemed to be alright. But the next day I woke up late and somebody phoned and said Jimi’s dead. Apparently he choked on his own vomit. Close friend: Stevens was with Hendrix the night he died and said he was mixing red wine and lager It had long been claimed that Hendrix – one of the best loved guitarists in the history of rock – died aged 27 from choking on vomit after a drugs overdose in 1970. But in 2009, the doctor who attempted to revive him at the now closed St Mary Abbotts Hospital in Kensington admitted it was 'plausible' that he was murdered. John Bannister said that medical evidence was consistent with claims in a book that Hendrix was killed on the orders of his manager, Mike Jeffery. James 'Tappy' Wright, a former road manager who worked for Jeffery, wrote in his memoir Rock Roadie, that in the early hours of September 18, 1970, a gang into the London hotel room where Hendrix was staying with his girlfriend, Monika Dannemann, and forced sleeping pills and wine down his throat until he drowned. Back in the day: Hendrix and Stevens were good friends He claimed Jeffery, beset with debts, had ordered the hit after taking a $2 million insurance policy out on the musician - telling him he was 'worth more dead than alive'. More than she knew? Hendrix with girlfriend Monika Dannemann Wright said Jeffery confessed to him he had ordered the attack before he died in an aircraft collision. Mr Bannister agreed that the description of the murder ""sounded plausible because of the volume of wine”. He said: ‘The amount of wine that was over him was just extraordinary. Not only was it saturated right through his hair and shirt but his lungs and stomach were absolutely full of wine. 'I have never seen so much wine. We had a sucker that you put down into his trachea, the entrance to his lungs and to the whole of the back of his throat. ‘We kept sucking him out and it kept surging and surging. He had already vomited up masses of red wine and I would have thought there was half a bottle of wine in his hair. He had really drowned in a massive amount of red wine.’ Former ice-skating instructor Miss Dannemann committed suicide in 1996 - many fans and conspiracy theorists were convinced she knew more about Hendrix’s death than she ever revealed.

About Hammer
There had been hit rap singles and albums before him, but MC Hammer was the man who truly brought rap music to a mass pop audience. Armed with a flamboyant wardrobe (particularly his trademark baggy parachute pants) and a raft of sampled hooks lifted straight from their sources, Hammer's talents as a dancer and showman far exceeded his technique as an MC. Still, he had an ear for catchy source material, and that helped his second album, Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em, become the best-selling rap album of all time. Even if he was never able to duplicate that level of success, and even if his street credibility was virtually non-existent, Hammer still broke down numerous doors for rap music in the mainstream, demonstrating that hip-hop had the potential for blockbuster success in the marketplace.
MC Hammer was born Stanley Kirk Burrell in Oakland, California on March 30, 1962. A member of a strongly religious family, he landed a job as a bat/ball boy for the Oakland Athletics baseball team, where he entertained fans by dancing during breaks in the game, and earned the nickname ""Hammer"" for his resemblance to all-time home run leader ""Hammerin'"" Hank Aaron. An aspiring ballplayer himself, he failed to catch on with a professional organization following high school, and enlisted in the Navy for three years. Long a fan of funk and soul, he became interested in hip-hop upon returning to civilian life, and began performing in local clubs; with the financial help of several Athletics players, he also started his own record label, Bustin' Records, and recorded a couple of popular local singles. With ex-Con Funk Shun mastermind Felton Pilate producing, Hammer recorded an album titled Feel My Power in 1987. After impressing a Capitol Records executive with his already elaborate live show, he was signed to a multi-album deal, the first of which was a revamped version of Feel My Power retitled Let's Get It Started. Producing an R&B hit in ""Turn This Mutha Out,"" Let's Get It Started went double platinum.
Still, nothing could have foreshadowed the phenomenon of Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em, the 1990-released follow-up. Its first single, ""U Can't Touch This,"" blatantly copped most of its hooks from Rick James' funk classic ""Super Freak,"" yet Hammer's added catch phrases (and young listeners' unfamiliarity with the original song) helped make it a smash. ""U Can't Touch This"" dominated radio and MTV during 1990 in a way few rap singles ever had, and won two Grammys (Best R&B Song, Best Solo Rap Performance); save for a quirk in its release format -- it was only available as a 12"", which cut down on its sales -- it would easily have been the first rap single to top the Billboard pop chart. The next two singles, ""Have You Seen Her"" (a flat-out cover of the Chi-Lites' '70s soul ballad) and ""Pray"" (built on the keyboard hook from Prince's ""When Doves Cry""), followed ""U Can't Touch This"" into the Top Ten, eventually pushing sales of Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em past the ten-million mark and making it the number one album of the year. Still, a backlash was growing against Hammer's frequent borrowing (some said theft) of classic hooks for his own hits; hip-hop purists also railed about his often simplistic, repetitive lyrics (indeed, ""Pray"" set a new record for the number of times its title was repeated during the song, at well over 100). The charges of rank commercialism weren't lessened by the merchandising machine that soon kicked in: endorsement deals, MC Hammer dolls, even a Saturday morning cartoon show.

Mini Bio (1)
Greta Garbo was born Greta Lovisa Gustafsson on September 18, 1905, in Stockholm, Sweden, to Anna Lovisa (Johansdotter), who worked at a jam factory, and Karl Alfred Gustafsson, a laborer. She was fourteen when her father died, which left the family destitute. Greta was forced to leave school and go to work in a department store. The store used her as a model in its newspaper ads. She had no film aspirations until she appeared in short advertising film at that same department store while she was still a teenager. Erik A. Petschler , a comedy director, saw the film and gave her a small part in his Luffar-Petter (1922). Encouraged by her own performance, she applied for and won a scholarship to a Swedish drama school. While there she appeared in at least one film, En lyckoriddare (1921). Both were small parts, but it was a start. Finally famed Swedish director Mauritz Stiller pulled her from the drama school for the lead role in The Saga of Gösta Berling (1924). At 18 Greta was on a roll.
Following The Joyless Street (1925) both Greta and Stiller were offered contracts with MGM, and her first film for the studio was the American-made Torrent (1926), a silent film in which she didn't have to speak a word of English. After a few more films, including The Temptress (1926), Love (1927) and A Woman of Affairs (1928), Greta starred in Anna Christie (1930) (her first ""talkie""), which not only gave her a powerful screen presence but also garnered her an Academy Award nomination as Best Actress (she didn't win). Later that year she filmed Romance (1930), which was somewhat of a letdown, but she bounced back in 1931, landing another lead role in Mata Hari (1931), which turned out to be a major hit.

tc_783,What is Osbert Lancaster best known for producing?,Cartoons,"Osbert Lancaster was active/lived in England. Osbert Lancaster is known for satirical cartoons, drawings, stage design. Sir Osbert Lancaster, CBE (4 August 1908 – 27 July 1986) was an English cartoonist, author, art critic and stage designer, best known to the public at large for his cartoons published in the Daily Express. Lancaster was born in London, England. He was educated at St Ronan's School and then at Charterhouse and Lincoln College, Oxford, where he became friends with John Betjeman, drew cartoons for the University magazine Cherwell, and developed his trademark upper-class persona. He graduated with a fourth-class degree in English after an extra year beyond the normal three years of study. Intending a career in law, he failed his bar exams and instead entered the Slade School of Art in London. Lancaster initially worked alongside Betjeman at the Architectural Review. In 1936 he published Progress at Pelvis Bay, the first of his many books of social and architectural satire. In 1939 he became cartoonist at the Daily Express, where he pioneered the pocket cartoon, a single-panel, single-column topical drawing appearing on the front page, since imitated in several British newspapers. In these he sympathetically mocked the British upper classes, personified by his characters William (8th Earl of Littlehampton, formerly Viscount Draynflete) and his wife Maudie. During his Express career Lancaster drew some 10,000 cartoons over a period of 40 years. During World War II, Lancaster worked in press censorship, then in Greece as a Foreign Office press attaché. During the war years his cartoons provided comic relief from the privations of rationing and bombing raids. After the war Lancaster published Classical Landscape with Figures (1947), The Saracen's Head (1948) and Drayneflete Revealed (1949), the last dealing with the Littlehamptons' architectural and artistic inheritances. Along with The Littlehampton Bequest (1973, foreword by Sir Roy Strong), it provided a humorous and satirical but very well-informed, survey of architectural and aesthetic trends in British and European history. In 1951 Lancaster worked with John Piper on designs for the Festival of Britain. This was followed by stage design work for opera, ballet and theatre including productions at Sadler's Wells and Glyndebourne, among them Frederick Ashton's production of La Fille mal gardée. Lancaster was firmly embedded in the British upper middle classes, as is made clear by his autobiographies All Done From Memory (1963) and With an Eye to the Future (1967), and in his books illustrated by himself. In his later life it was observed that he affected a caricatured persona similar to those depicted in his drawings. When he was knighted in 1975 he became one of only a small number of cartoonists to have received the honour, John Tenniel and David Low being others. Lancaster was the illustrator of many books by other writers, including Noblesse Oblige (London, Hamish Hamilton, 1973, edited by Nancy Mitford, and some editions of C. Northcote Parkinson's books, including Parkinson's Law, its sequel The Law and the Profits, In-laws & Outlaws, and Law of Delay. Lancaster was married twice: first, to Karen Elizabeth Harris, daughter of Sir Austen Harris, with whom he had a son, William and a daughter, Kara; second, after Karen died in 1964, to the journalist Anne Scott-James, whom he married in 1967 and who became his widow. Apart from his knighthood, Lancaster's honours included a CBE in 1953 and an honorary DLitt from Oxford, as well as honorary degrees from Birmingham (1964), Newcastle upon Tyne (1970), and St Andrews (1974). Lancaster died of natural causes, aged 77, in Chelsea. The obituary in The Times summed up his career: ""The most polite and unsplenetic of cartoonists, he was never a crusader, remaining always a witty, civilized critic with a profound understanding of the vagaries of human nature."" He is buried at West Winch, Norfolk. Exhibitions Lancaster's drawings and cartoons were the subject of an exhibition marking the centenary of his birth, entitled ""Cartoons and Coronets: The Genius of Osbert Lancaster"" at The Wallace Collection from October 2008 to January 2009. Curated by James Knox and supported by the John R. Murray Charitable Trust of John Murray, it coincided with the publication of a new biography with the same title as the exhibition.","The context explicitly mentions that Osbert Lancaster is best known for his cartoons published in the Daily Express, and that he pioneered the pocket cartoon format.

Five major, junior, and invitational events are held each year. Wimbledon traditions include a strict dress code for competitors and Royal patronage. The tournament is also notable for the absence of sponsor advertising around the courts.

Who Was First American Golfer to Win the British Open?
By Brent Kelley
Updated March 05, 2016.
So who was the first American golfer to win the Open Championship ? There are actually two different golfers who qualify as a correct answer to that question, because you can pose the question two different ways:
Who was the first American citizen to win the British Open? Answer: Jock Hutchison.
Who was the first golfer born in the United States to win the British Open? Answer: Walter Hagen .
The answers are different, but the two golfers who are the answers to these questions won their Open Championships in back-to-back years.
First American Citizen to Win the British Open
Jock Hutchison is the golfer who has the distinction of being the first citizen of the United States to win the Open Championship. He did it at the 1921 British Open .
Hutchison was a Scotsman by birth; in fact, he was born in St. Andrews. But he gained American citizenship in 1920. The next year, the Open was played at The Old Course at St. Andrews , and Hutchison returned to his native home to play it.

How to Throw a Perfect Spiral in Football
Good decision! Hutchison won that Open in a playoff over amateur Roger Wethered. Odd twist to the story: Wethered had to be talked into showing up for the playoff. Read our recap of the tournament for more.
First USA-Born Golfer to Win the British Open
Just one year after Hutchison's victory, ""The Haig,"" Walter Hagen, won the 1922 British Open to become the first native-born American winner of the Open Championship. Hagen beat his rival Jim Barnes - they battled frequently in PGA Championships - by one stroke at Royal St. George's Golf Club .
Hagen was born in Rochester, New York. So although he was the first American-born winner, he was also the second consecutive American to win the Open!
In fact, after Arthur Havers' victory in 1923, the next 10 Open champions were all Americans. They included USA-born golfers Hagen, Bobby Jones , Gene Sarazen and Denny Shute ; and golfers who had acquired American citizenship, Barnes and Tommy Armour .","The context explicitly states that Walter Hagen was the first US-born winner of the British Open, as he was born in Rochester, New York, and won the 1922 tournament.

tc_841,In which country is the Sky Train Rail bridge?,Canada,"Vancouver Skytrain is a light rail train that offers a great way to get around. ... The Sky Train is one of Vancouver’s best transportation bargains. Take The Sky Train – BCPassport Shopping Take The Sky Train The Sky Train is one of Vancouver’s best transportation bargains. For the price of a DayPass, $9.00, you can ride it the length of its route and return. You can take side trips on the SeaBus to the North Shore or ride as many of Vancouver’s 1000 buses as you can squeeze into the day. DayPasses are available at the SeaBus station, Sky Train station, Safeway grocery stores, 7/11 convenience stores, Save On Foods and at many London Drugs and Shoppers’ Drug Marts. The Sky Train is not just a bargain, however. It is one of the best ways to see Vancouver and the surrounding area. From the SkyTrain, you get great views of downtown, neighborhoods and the splendor of the North Shore mountains. And perhaps, best of all, the SkyTrain’s CanadaLine travels between Vancouver International Airport and downtown Vancouver every 8 minutes at peak hours and every 12 minutes in early morning and evening  for $3.25 per person one way. This 25 minute trip is scenic, fast and worry free. It’s the perfect way to get between downtown Vancouver and the airport. You can catch the Sky Train at any Sky Train stop, but for this itinerary, we’ll assume you’re picking it up next to Canada Place, at Waterfront Station, which is its terminus. If you only want to go to the heart of downtown, take the SkyTrain two stops and exit at the Granville Station. That will put you in the heart of downtown Vancouver. You can shop at Pacific Centre Mall or walk a couple of blocks south on Granville to Vancouver’s most fashionable shopping area, Robson Street. If you want to see some of the attractions outside Vancouver proper, the SkyTrain is an easy way to do it. For example, you can take the SkyTrain to Metrotown, B.C’s largest shopping complex with over 500 shops and services, 22 cinemas and the Metropolis Entertainment Centre. Metrotown is only eight stops from the Waterfront Station. Six stops beyond Metrotown is the centre of New West, Columbia Station. It puts you near the Canada Games Pool where you can swim in the Olympic size swimming pool or work out in the fitness centre and training circuit. The facility is open daily from 6:30am-10:30pm. From the SkyTrain, transfer to Bus #102. You can also visit the West Coast College of Massage Therapy just two blocks west (right) of Columbia Station. WCCMT offers massage therapy as well as herbal and aromatic baths, clay packs, fullbody wraps and salt glow therapy. Services are provided by advanced students under the supervision of an instructor. The WCCMT is open Monday – Friday 9:00 am to 8:00 PM and Saturday 9:00 am-4:00pm. From The Columbia Station you are just four stops from completing the entire 39 minute grand tour to the end of the line Surrey’s King George Station. On your return trip, leave the SkyTrain at the Science World-Main St. Station. From there, pick up an Aquabus or False Creek Ferry for a tour of False Creek. The Aquabus stops at Hornby Street, Granville Island, Yaletown and Science World. Bicycles & dogs are welcome. Ferries operate every day 7 am – 8 PM in winter and 7 am – 10 PM in summer. To get back to downtown Vancouver after your ferry trip, either get back on the SkyTrain or take the bus, the number of which will depend on where you leave the ferry.","The context mentions that the SkyTrain operates in Vancouver, which is a city in Canada. Therefore, the Sky Train Rail bridge is located in Canada.",23,1,1,1,1,1

On 4 January 1958 Sir Edmund Hillary and his New Zealand party reached the South Pole. They were the first to do so overland since Scott in 1912, and the first to reach it in motor vehicles. The party set out for the Pole after laying food and fuel depots for the British crossing party of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition (TAE). It was an arduous journey – long hours were spent battling through sastrugi (wind-eroded snow ridges), soft snow and dangerous crevasses. But what is often remembered is Hillary's determination to proceed with the journey without the express permission of the TAE, and against the instructions of the committee coordinating New Zealand's contribution.",The context explicitly states that Sir Edmund Hillary and his New Zealand party were the first to reach the South Pole overland since Robert Falcon Scott in 1912.

In November, the Spice Girls released their debut album Spice in Europe. Good Fight Ministries - The Spice Girls Good Fight Ministries Support The Spice Girls The Spice Girls took the world of pop by storm as their debut album sold over 20 million copies, and they were catapulted to overnight super stardom and worldwide fame. They have been billed as the “biggest all girl group of all time”, and their meteoritic rise to fame was said to have only been bypassed by the Beatles before them. So successful and influential was the initial success of the Spice Girls that Pepsi gave them one and a half million dollars to advertise their cola. If the Spice Girls were influencing teens and preteens with Pepsi alone, we would not have to do an exposé on this group. Due to the fact that the Spice Girls are influencing their millions of fans with more than sugar and spice, we deem it necessary to alert both their fans, as well as parents who love their children, about the poison that underlies the candy coating veneer of the Spice Girls. The lyrical content of their songs, as well as their examples as role models, is enough to turn your daughters into tramps just as quickly as the Spice Girls became a sensation. The Spice Girls have put far more time and emotion into their infomercials promoting sexual promiscuity than they have into the array of products they now advertise. The Spice Girls, as you will see, are far from some innocent teeny-bopper group which poses little or no threat on our youth. On the contrary, the fact that they have been packaged and promoted as a bubble gum group with an innocuous message that has deceived many a parent, warrants even greater alarm. Since their audience is largely pre-pubescent, their message becomes all the more unconscionable and needs to be exposed. You should be aware, whether you are a young person or an adult, the Spice Girls are not girls at all, they are fully grown women who are old enough to be the mothers of many of the children they are leading astray.","The context explicitly mentions that Pepsi gave the Spice Girls one and a half million dollars to advertise their cola, indicating that the Spice Girls promoted Pepsi.",34,1,1,1,1,1

Credit: NASA Neil A. Armstrong was a NASA astronaut and the first man on the moon or, more accurately, the first man to set foot on the moon. He was also an accomplished test pilot and a figure so large in American and world history that you can bet many generations from now people will still be talking about him, as well as his moon landing. Editor's Note: Neil Armstrong died on Aug. 25, 2012. He was 82. One year after his death, NASA recalled the iconic astronaut's legacy in a video tribute. The Truth About Neil Armstrong (Op-Ed) Here are some frequently asked questions about him: Who was Neil Armstrong? He is best known as being the first man to step on the moon (fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin arrived at the moon at the same time, but was the second man to actually set foot on the lunar surface). Since Armstrong was the mission’s pilot, it’s also said that he was the first person to land a craft on the moon. Where was Neil Armstrong from? He was born in Wapakoneta, Ohio, on Aug. 5, 1930. His parents were Stephen Koenig Armstrong and Viola Louise Engel. What mission did Armstrong fly to the moon? Apollo 11 was the name of the first manned lunar landing mission. When was the first moon landing? Apollo 11 touched down on the lunar surface on July 20, 1969. That was more than eight years after President John F. Kennedy gave his historic speech in which he said, “First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth.” Who was the first person in space? Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin orbited Earth on April 12, 1961, giving the Soviet Union a big victory in its Cold War space race against the United States. [ Giant Leaps: Top Milestones of Human Spaceflight ] NASA test pilot Neil Armstrong is seen here next to the X-15 ship #1 after a research flight. Credit: NASA Other facts in the history of Armstrong’s career: Armstrong was a naval aviator from 1949 to 1952. He served in the Korean War. Well before he made spaceflight history, Armstrong got a bachelor of science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Purdue University in 1955 (later, he received a master of science in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Southern California in 1970.) As a NASA test pilot , Armstrong flew the X-15, a rocket-powered, missile-shaped aircraft that tested the limits of high-altitude flight. He flew more than 200 different aircraft, from jets to gliders and even helicopters. Armstrong was the pilot of the Gemini 8 mission, launched March 16, 1966. He performed the first successful docking of two vehicles in space (Gemini 8 docked with a previously launched Agena rocket). After his time as an astronaut, Armstrong was Deputy Associate Administrator for Aeronautics at NASA Headquarters. From 1971-1979, he was Professor of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati. From 1982-1992, Armstrong was chairman of Computing Technologies for Aviation, Inc., Charlottesville, Va. Armstrong largely avoided the public spotlight after his astronaut days. But he remained a vocal supporter of suborbital spaceflight . On the other hand, the former Apollo astronaut was publicly critical of plans to shift the crew-carrying burden in spaceflight from NASA to private spaceships. Related: NASA -  Apollo 11 -- First Footprint on the Moon Apollo 11 -- First Footprint on the Moon 07.08.04 In 1961, President John F. Kennedy gave a speech. He said that the U.S. should work quickly and meet a goal. The goal was to send people to the Moon and back. The U.S. did meet the goal. And it only took eight years. One day in July, Apollo 11 launched towards the Moon. It had three astronauts on it. They were Neil Armstrong, Edwin (Buzz) Aldrin and Michael Collins.","The context explicitly mentions that the Apollo 11 mission touched down on the lunar surface on July 20, 1969, which is the date Neil Armstrong first set foot on the Moon.",27,1,1,1,1,1

Strand asked Zavattini to choose a village with the elusive ""special quality"" he sought. Zavattini knew just such a village: his own birthplace of Luzzara, in the Po Valley. The collaboration of these two remarkable artists resulted in the classic book Un Paese. Published in Italian in 1955, and now available for the first time in the English language, Un Paese captures in photographs and in spoken testimony the essential experience of daily life in Luzzara. It presents a series of intense portraits, graceful landscapes, and images of everyday objects. Paul Strand's photographs are carefully distilled, deeply powerful; they contain the flavors and the rhythms of an entire culture crystallized in a single village. Zavattini successfully synthesizes text and image, aligning with the new cinematic trend of the day, a movement known as Italian neorealism. Their Luzzara is an ordinary village, neither overly picturesque nor greatly unusual, yet it is a town sustained by a grounded humanity and a profound love for the land by its people Tìr a'mhurain : Outer Hebrides by Paul Strand( Book ) 7 editions published between 1962 and 1968 in English and held by 278 WorldCat member libraries worldwide Strand : under the dark cloth by John Walker( Visual ) 5 editions published between 1990 and 2002 in English and held by 224 WorldCat member libraries worldwide [...]","The context explicitly states that Paul Strand was a photographer and filmmaker.

tc_1004,Who had a 60s No 1 with Downtown?,Petula Clark,"Downtown by Petula Clark Songfacts
Songfacts
This was Petula Clark's first hit in the US, which was slow to discover her talents. In the UK, she was a star as a singer and as a television performer, where she was a regular on the BBC. In the early '60s, she also caught on in France when she started recording her songs in French. Oddly, she didn't get an American record deal until late in 1964 when a Warner Bros. executive named Joe Smith, who was vacationing in England, heard the song and signed her to a deal.
When ""Downtown"" was released in the US, it shot to #1, making Petula the first female singer from the UK to hit #1 in the US during the rock era (after 1955). Remarkably, she didn't even promote the song before it hit the top spot, as she was touring French-speaking countries at the time. ""The Ed Sullivan Show had been calling every day while I was on tour in Canada saying, 'You've got to get here,'"" Petula told us. ""I couldn't get there. Eventually I got there, and the record was #1."" (Here's our full Petula Clark interview .)
On the surface, this song is about having a delightful time during a trip downtown. But what happens when the night is over and the singer returns to her everyday life? After all, the trip into the city is merely an escape.
While many listeners don't process the song on this level, Petula does. An accomplished actress, she thinks of her songs as ""mini movies"" when she performs them, and considers the feelings behind them. This song, to her, isn't so chipper. ""I've always thought there was this loneliness and there's even a slight feeling of desperation in it,"" she told us.
A British songwriter and producer named Tony Hatch wrote this. During the '60s, he wrote most of Clark's material, including her follow-up hit ""I Know a Place"" (which also dealt with city life). Hatch was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2013.
Does Petula envision a specific downtown when she performs this song? Here's what she told us: ""It's usually a general image of the sense of getting out and seeing something else. This idea of being alone... I've been there. I have my down days when I'm feeling alone and a bit sorry for myself. And the best thing to do if you can is just to get out there and think about something else and see something else and possibly even talk to someone else - without getting your head bashed in. Not to get too deep into your own solitude and sadness.""
The word ""downtown"" has a different meaning in America than it does in the UK. In America, ""downtown"" is the heart of the city where the action happens. The word isn't used much in Britain, but it generally means the less affluent part of the town's central area. The song's writer, Tony Hatch, used the word in its American meaning as he was inspired by a walk down Broadway during his first visit to New York.
Allan Sherman did a parody of this song called ""Crazy Downtown,"" which went to #40 in the US in August 1965. Sherman's song is about how the parents are elated when their children go downtown, as they finally have some time to themselves at home.
Petula Clark came to record this song at a time when she had carved a successful career in French, Italian and German-speaking territories. She recalled to The Guardian that Tony Hatch suggested she should be recording again in English. ""My head wasn't in it at the time,"" she admitted, ""I was totally into French, Italian, German, whatever. I said: 'Well, you know, if I could find the right song' and he said he had an unfinished song he wanted to play me, and he played 'Downtown' on the piano. I said: 'Woah, I like that.' So I asked him to write a lyric up to the standard of the tune, and two weeks later we did it.""
This won a Grammy in 1965 for Best Rock & Roll Recording, making Clark the first British singer to win a Grammy. In 2003, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. >>

After the words, ""And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you,"" there is the drum roll from Little Peggy March's #1 version of the French tune ""Chariot."" In 1962 Petula had a big continental hit with the same song, which was also known as ""I Will Follow Him.""
Clark recorded a new version of this song for her 2013 album Lost in You, which was released when she was 80 years old.","The context explicitly states that ""Downtown"" was Petula Clark's first hit in the US and reached No. 1 in the 1960s. It also mentions that she was the first female singer from the UK to achieve a No. 1 in the US during the rock era after 1955. This confirms that Petula Clark had a 60s No 1 with ""Downtown.""",46,1,1,1,1,1

It's the only guitar Hendrix burned that remains complete
Shares
Now that's what you call a Relic'd Strat
Image 2 of 2
Back in March 1967, Jimi Hendrix gave a landmark performance at the Finsbury Astoria, London, where he closed his set by setting fire to his Fender Strat. Now that guitar is up for auction and is forecast to command a $1 million-plus price.
Hendrix played the Astoria as support act on the opening night of the Walker Brothers tour on 31 March 1967. Hendrix was only allowed into the UK on a temporary visa at the time, so was determined to leave an indelible impact on the audience. After he'd instructed his press officer, Tony Garland, to buy lighter fluid from a local hardware store, Hendrix redefined the art of stagecraft by setting fire to his guitar at the end of his set. He was then taken to hospital with minor hand injuries.
The guitar has since been in the keep of Tony Garland and remains in one piece.
""We can only find evidence of Hendrix definitively burning two guitars,"" says Ted Owen, of auctioneers The Fame Bureau. ""And because this piece is a one-off original, I feel that this is the most important Hendrix guitar ever to be offered for sale - even eclipsing the Woodstock Stratocaster which eventually sold for $1.8 million.""
Though Owen would say that. He's on a percentage.
What price history?
That said, these guitar auctions are weirdly exciting affairs. This MusicRadar writer was at Sotheby's in 1990, at the first auction of the iconic Fender Stratocaster Hendrix played at Woodstock. Everyone in the auction room was aghast when the Strat, sold by JH Experience drummer Mitch Mitchell, went for a 'huge' £198,000. It was, back then, the most expensive guitar ever sold at auction.
In 2008, that money wouldn't probably buy you the shoes Jimi wore on that day. And a few years later, the Woodstock Strat was bought - as Owen says - for $1.8 million.
Hendrix famously repeated his guitar burning stunt at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 (see Related Links), but the Astoria Strat remains the only burnt guitar that is fully intact. The only doubt in my mind over the estimated price for the Astoria Strat is this: Jimi's Monterey pyromania was caught on film and on (still) camera. For that reason alone, the Monterey Strat is possibly more iconic.
The auction takes place on 4 September. The auction also includes the last surviving drum kit of Led Zeppelin's John Bonham, Jim Morrison's final notebook of poetry and musings before his death from Paris in 1971, and a songsheet for USA For Africa's We Are The World signed by the Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan and more.
MusicRadar will be in the front row. With shallow wallets.

Read more Read {{ review.expanded ? 'less' : 'more' }}
The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum is a unique  Boston  experience. Entering the beautiful flower-filled courtyard garden leading to the artfully cluttered galleries is like visiting the home of an eccentric great-aunt you didn't know you had. Built to Mrs. Gardner's specifications, almost everything in the museum was placed there by Mrs. Gardner herself when the museum opened in 1903. The result is a fascinating, sometimes frustrating collection of Renaissance, Dutch, Asian and American art, books, manuscripts and decorative arts. The Gardner is also known for its excellent concert and performance series and popular bistro cafe.
Best and worst time to visit the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum
Lines to enter the museum are usually long, but arrive early to mid-morning and you might get at least a few of the galleries to yourself. Afternoon brings crowds and fills up the popular Cafe G. The museum hosts its very popular Third Thursdays from 5-8, featuring music, a cash wine bar and special events in the galleries. Check the museum's calendar for concerts, open studio opportunities and even afternoon yoga classes in the courtyard. Events sell out early, so buy tickets online in advance.
Must see/do at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum
In 1990 the museum was the victim of  one of the great art thefts  in American history. Most of the paintings, including three by Rembrandt, were taken from the Dutch Room on the second floor. There you'll see the empty frames where the missing paintings once hung -- a strangely eerie sight and something you aren't likely to see in any other museum. Downstairs on the first floor, The Blue Room features works of American portrait painter and close friend of Mrs. Gardner, John Singer Sargent. The museum's showpiece and centerpiece of the Titian Room is Titian's masterpiece, Europa. It was purchased by Mrs. Gardner in 1896 for a record-breaking price. Many art historians consider this one of the greatest European paintings on display in the United States.
Admission to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum
The Gardner Museum has a variety of admission programs as well as many discounts and special offers. Admission to the museum averages about $15, with children under 18, members of the U.S. military and their families admitted free. Members of the  Museum of Fine Arts  and visitors who have a ticket stub from the MFA within the previous two days receive a $2 discount. (Likewise, your Gardner ticket will earn you $2 off an MFA admission.) There is also free admission to anyone celebrating a birthday and for everyone named Isabella.
Parking and public transportation to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum
Located in the heart of  the Fenway , the very best way to get to the museum is via subway or the 'T.'
Take either the Green Line E train (make sure you're on an E train outbound toward Heath Street or Arborway, no other Green Line train will get you there) or the 39 bus to the Museum of Fine Arts stop. You'll see the Museum of Fine Arts as you disembark. Cross Huntington Avenue toward the Museum on to Louis Prang Street. The Gardner is two blocks away on your left. If you decide to drive, there is very limited on-street parking and Boston's meter maids are vigilant about ticketing expired meters. There are paid parking lots and garages near the Museum of Fine Arts on Museum Road. Once you've parked, it's a fairly pleasant walk along the Fenway toward Louis Prang Street and the museum.
Food at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum
Housed in the museum's new contemporary wing, Cafe G is a popular dining spot for both museum visitors as well as locals who appreciate the atmosphere as well as the food. The menu consists of seasonal specialties, small plates, main courses and desserts with prices comparable to other Boston-area restaurants. Visitors looking for a quick snack or who are dining on a budget might consider heading back down Huntington Avenue toward the  Prudential Center . Here you'll find a variety of interesting budget-friendly snack options surrounding the campus of nearby  Northeastern University .
Insider tip for visitors to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum
Ask for help. The Gardner Museum galleries are arranged in a style popular in the early 20th century -- paintings are hung practically floor to ceiling with no descriptions attached. To know what you're looking at or to find something you want to look at, spring for the self-guided audio tour or a take a noontime tour with a museum guide.

Editorial Reviews
Barnes & Noble
Adapted for the screen from Alan Bennett's hit London stage production by Bennett himself, The Madness of King George is an ebullient, witty, and surprisingly sympathetic portrait of the insanity of politics and the politics of insanity. Directed with grace and assurance by first-time director Nicholas Hytner , the film manages to strike a balance between scatological irreverence and subdued tenderness in its treatment of its titular subject. Portrayed as both a blundering autocrat and a genuinely disturbed man, George is brought to life by Nigel Hawthorne (who also played him on the stage) in a performance that carries the entire film. He is ably supported by a cast of seasoned performers, most notably Helen Mirren as his long-suffering but loving wife, and Ian Holm as the irascible Dr. Willis, the physician who attempts to treat the king through a variety of unorthodox methods. Hawthorne's scenes with both Mirren and Holm provide the film with its more memorable and lucid moments, and they layer his character with added dimensions. The affectionate interludes between the king and his wife communicate genuine poignancy, while the battle of wills between the king and Dr. Willis provides the film with its centerpiece. At the end of it all, Hawthorne emerges triumphant, his George III scarred but spirited, willing to fight the good fight until he can fight no more. — Rebecca Flint

Notable British Films:
The      most successful British film of the first half of the decade was Mike      Newell's surprise hit Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), an intelligent,      well-scripted romantic adult comedy about the major rites of passage in      life (and death). It featured a long-running romance between a reserved      Britisher and confirmed bachelor (Hugh Grant) and attractive American      (Andie MacDowell), with a hilarious bit-part by Rowan Atkinson (aka Mr.      Bean). Writer-director Scott Hicks' Australian/UK film Shine (1996) told the story of recovering gifted pianist David Helfgott (Best Actor-winning      Geoffrey Rush) with a history of mental problems. Due to the film's popularity,      the real-life Helfgott went on a musical concert tour, but received mostly      negative reviews.
The decade's most successful British film was first-time        director Peter Cattaneo's Best Picture-nominated The Full Monty (1997) about a group of displaced, unemployed Sheffield steel-mill workers who        become 'Chippendale-style' male strippers. It brought new popularity to        two hits: Hot Chocolate's ""You Sexy Thing,"" and Donna Summers' ""Hot Stuff."" The edgy and visually-fresh film about drug addiction, Trainspotting (1995) was based upon Irving Welsh's famous novel        set in Edinburgh, with original Scottish characters (and unknown actors)        including Renton, Spud, Sick Boy and Begbie, and featuring a pulsing soundtrack        with Iggy Pop singing ""Lust for Life"". Although not a British        film, Rob Roy (1995) starred Liam Neeson as 18th century Scottish        legend Robert Roy MacGregor based upon Sir Walter Scott's legendary novel.
Distinctive Independent Film-Makers:
In the 90s' era of blockbusters, independent films made            significant headway. The major studios set up specialty art-house production            and distribution divisions, such as Sony Pictures Classics and Fox World Cinema. There were any number of shoestring-budget, non-mainstream            films that appealed to disenchanted Generation-Xers, from directors such            as Richard Linklater, Kevin Smith, Edward Burns, Todd Solondz, Gus Van            Sant and Jim Jarmusch.
Richard Linklater
Writer/director                Richard Linklater's first feature Slacker (1991) was a free-form,                low-budget film that defined a generation of dead-beat, drop-out, misfit                individuals living on the edge of the college town of Austin, Texas during                a 24-hour period. [Many of Linklater's films would be contained within                a 24-hour time frame.] The word 'slacker' was immediately seized upon                as a word to define a group within the twenty-something subculture. His                next film, a rambling ensemble drama Dazed and Confused (1993),                dubbed 'the American Graffiti (1973) of                the 90s', followed graduating Texas high-school students on their last                academic day in the Bicentennial year of 1976. The quotable, archetypal                film introduced many exceptional acting newcomers to audiences, including                Milla Jovovich, Ben Affleck, Parker Posey, Renee Zellweger, Matthew McConaughey, Cole Hauser, Adam Goldberg, and Joey Lauren Adams.
Linklater's more accessible and sweet film Before                  Sunrise (1995) followed the overnight budding romance between a traveling                  young American (Ethan Hawke) and a French student (Julie Delpy) in Vienna,                  and the dialogue-heavy SuBurbia (1997), an adaptation of writer/actor                  Eric Bogosian's play, examined a group of punk twenty-somethings outside                  a suburban Austin convenience store. In the new decade, Linklater's innovative                  6th film, Waking Life (2001) combined digital video and animation                  to produce a highly philosophical avant-garde film.

For more information visit gildashedstecker.com What Ever Happened to Baby Jane Bosley Crowther in the New York Times November 7, 1962 Joan Crawford and Bette Davis make a couple of formidable freaks in the new Robert Aldrich melodrama, ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"" But we're afraid this unique conjunction of the two one-time top-ranking stars in a story about two aging sisters who were once theatrical celebrities themselves does not afford either opportunity to do more than wear grotesque costumes, make up to look like witches and chew the scenery to shreds. As this pair of profoundly jealous has-beens who live alone in an old Hollywood house, where one of them (Miss Crawford), a cripple, is confined to a wheelchair as the result of a long-ago vindictive ""accident,"" they do get off some amusing and eventually blood-chilling displays of screaming sororal hatred and general monstrousness. Especially Miss Davis. As the mobile one who is slowly torturing to death the helpless sister whose fame as a movie actress eclipsed her own as a child vaudeville star, she shrieks and shrills in brazen fashion, bats her huge mascaraed eyes with evil glee, snarls at the charitable neighbors and acts like a maniac. Indeed, it is only as a maniac that her character can be credited here�a sadly demented creature who is simply working out an ancient spite. If you see her as that and see this picture, which opened yesterday in several score neighborhood theaters, as a ""chiller"" of the old-fashioned type�as a straight exercise in studied horror�you may find it a fairly gripping film.","The context explicitly mentions that the film ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" served to revive the careers of both Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. Specifically, it states that the film ""revived the flagging careers of its two leading ladies"" and that Joan Crawford ""does a great job in it as well but she mostly"" contributed to the film's success. This indicates that Joan's career was revitalized by the film.",129,1,1,1,1,1

Biography of Mr. Fred Astaire
Fred Astaire began his show business career in 1894, at the age of 5, performing on Broadway and in a vaudeville act with his sister, Adele. He soon headed to Hollywood where he and Ginger Rogers formed one of the most iconic dance partnerships in entertainment history.
He then continued his successful partnership with Ginger Rogers for nine movies. By 1976, he had starred in more than 30 musical films with the biggest male and female co-stars of the era, including Joan Crawford, Bing Crosby, Red Skelton, Rita Hayworth, Ann Miller, Debbie Reynolds, Gene Kelly, and Cyd Charisse.
In addition to his expertise as a dancer, Fred Astaire was also an accomplished actor, starring in a variety of dramatic and comedic roles on the big screen and television. His television work earned him multiple Emmys, and he earned an Oscar nomination in 1974 for his role in The Towering Inferno. He received an honorary Academy Award in 1950 for his ""unique artistry and his contributions to the technique of musical pictures.""
With his passing from pneumonia in 1987, we lost a true dancing legend, the likes of which may never be seen again. As Mikhail Baryshnikov observed at the time of his death, ""No dancer can watch Fred Astaire and not know that we all should have been in another business.""
Fred Astaire's Dance Partners
In addition to his legendary work with Ginger Rogers, Fred Astaire also danced with the top leading ladies of his time, including Cyd Charisse, Lucille Bremer, Joan Leslie, Leslie Caron, Vera Ellen, Barrie Chase, Judy Garland, Eleanor Powell and Rita Hayworth.
""For ballroom dancing, remember that your partners have their own distinctive styles also. Cultivate flexibility. Be able to adapt your style to that of your partner. In doing so, you are not surrendering your individuality, but blending it with that of your partner.""
- Fred Astaire from The Fred Astaire Top Hat Dance Album, 1936
Fred Astaire Films
Fred Astaire starred in 31 musical films, including his work with Ginger Rogers in the following films:

Founded in 1910 just outside of the city limits of Gilbert located in Lanville County, Texas, the Chicken Ranch has for generations been known as the best whorehouse in Texas for its wholesome fun, strict moral code and cleanliness, all perpetuated by its original owner, Miss Wulla Jean. Seven years ago, Miss Wulla Jean passed on, leaving the Chicken Ranch to her favorite working girl, Miss Mona Stangley, who wants to keep the same traditions of Miss Wulla Jean. The Chicken Ranch has always had the unofficial blessing of the local authorities, who see the ranch providing an important community service, one which most in local authority have used at one time or another in their life. In fact, Miss Mona and Lanville County Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd have been in a relationship for years, Ed Earl who is Miss Mona's protector, albeit one with a hot temper and good ol' boy attitude that doesn't exactly match the needs of his law upholding position. That blessing may change when television ... Written by Huggo

Former world No.1 Martina Hingis (left) is following mother Melanie Molitor's footsteps by coaching future tennis players at a new tennis center in Barcelona, Spain.
Hingis had a prolific early career. Her fans at the 1997 Australian Open ask whether the 16-year-old ""Swiss Miss"" can make history by becoming the youngest grand slam winner...
... The answer is yes! Hingis defeats Mary Pierce of France to win the Australian Open and becomes the youngest grand slam winner aged 16 years, three months and 26 days.
Hingis is comforted by her mom after losing a turbulent French Open in 1999 to Germany's Steffi Graf. The French is the only grand slam Hingis failed to win.
Hingis won five grand slam singles titles in her career but injuries -- and allegations over a failed drug test -- prompt the Swiss star to announce her retirement in 2007.
More time away from tennis allows Hings to pursue her lifelong hobby of horse riding.
But in 2013 Hingis makes another surprise return to tennis, exclusively playing doubles. In 2014, she is partnering Germany's Sabine Lisicki, who she also happens to be coaching.
Time to flash her trademark smile as Hingis and Lisicki win the Sony Open in Miami in March. For Hingis, it is her first title in seven years.

(CNN) -- Swiss tennis star Martina Hingis is still finding mother knows best at the age of 33.
Coached for much of her career by her mom Melanie Molitor -- said to have named her daughter after another tennis icon, Martina Navratilova -- the five-time grand slam champion is using her mother's advice both on and off the court.
Hingis conjured some of her old tennis nous to surprisingly win the Sony Open doubles title alongside German Sabine Lisicki in Miami last month.
But the doubles victory was just a diversion for Hingis, who is also borrowing some inspiration from her mom with a blossoming career as a tennis coach.
""I think a lot more about my mum now,"" Hingis tells CNN's Open Court with a flash of her trademark smile.
It's never easy to coach anybody. She's the best. She really helps to coach and to mentor. She has so much more experience.

""It's never easy to coach anybody. She's the best. She really helps to coach and to mentor. She has so much more experience.""
Hingis is presiding over a brood of young players on the clay courts of her new tennis center at Barcelona's Real Club de Polo .
As the juniors run drills round the red clay, her mom drops in to lend a hand and is soon on court with a pile of tennis balls heaped onto her racquet, ready for business.
""The goal is to grow slowly,"" says Hingis of the new project, which she started in collaboration with former top-10 player Felix Mantilla and Karim Perona, who coaches Tommy Robredo and Flavia Pennetta.
""It's a small, elite group of pros but in the future we want to work with kids, amateurs, veterans all the players. Anyone who wants to come here and learn is welcome.""",The context explicitly states that Melanie Molitor is Martina Hingis' mother and that Hingis followed her mother's footsteps in coaching.,31,1,1,1,1,1

See Gustav Klimt's legendary painting ""The Kiss"" as well as major works by Schiele and Kokoschka for yourself. You’ll be delighted by the magnificent ba-roque palace complex and its extensive gardens.
Prince Eugene of Savoy (1663-1736), successful general and art connoisseur, had Belve-dere garden palace built by Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt as his summer residence – at the time it was still outside the gates of the city.
This baroque architectural jewel consists of two palaces (Upper and Lower Belvedere), which today house Austrian art from the Middle Ages to the present day.
Upper Belvedere - world's largest Klimt collection
At the heart of the collections at the Belvedere are the works of Gustav Klimt with his golden paintings ""The Kiss"" and ""Judith"". The masterpieces by Schiele and Kokoschka as well as works of French Impressionism and highlights of the Vienna Biedermeier era (Waldmüller, Amerling, Fendi) that you will see here are every bit as impressive as the paintings of Makart, Boeckl, Wotruba, Hausner, Hundertwasser and others.
Masterworks of late Gothic art like the Znaim Altar, works by Michael Pacher, Rueland Frueauf the Elder and Conrad Laib are also on display here, along with lavish works of art dating from the baroque age. Significant works by Johann Michael Rottmayr, Daniel Gran and Paul Troger give a fascinating insight into the wealth of these times. The grimacing character heads by the sculptor Franz Xaver Messerschmidt are also very emotive.
Lower Belvedere - Prince Eugene’s apartments and staterooms
The feudal splendor of the palace’s aristocratic owner is reflected in the Hall of Grotesques, the Marble Gallery, and the Golden Room. Intriguing special exhibitions are staged in the Lower Belvedere and the Orangery.
Palace stables – Medieval Study Collection
The stables once housed the prince's 12 finest horses: today you will find the Belvedere's entire medieval art collection here.

If Today is Your Birthday November Twenty Sixth
Personality Profile for People Born on November 26
The following descriptions reveal some of the characteristics of people who share a birthday—those who are born on November 26th of any year—based on various methods used in Astrology, Numerology, and Cartomancy. Note that both Astrology and Numerology reveal much more depth when a birth year, and in the case of the former, a birth time and place are included.
The Astrology & Numerology of your Birthday
Your Sun is in Sagittarius in the Sagittarius decanate and quadrant.
The ruler of your Sun in Sagittarius is Jupiter. Jupiter is jovial, optimistic, idealistic, and philosophical. Born in the first decanate, you have a hearty sense of humor and fun, yet you seek to learn about the big picture so that you are not merely fun and games.
Your Sun Sign:
Sagittarius, the Archer
Sagittarius has a lively personality and is an optimist. Considered one of the most fun-loving signs of the zodiac, Sagittarians are direct, forthright, and sometimes completely tactless as they say exactly what they’re thinking! This can be seen as refreshing honesty, or bluntness, depending on the audience. Sagittarius is restless and inquisitive, and often will make quick jaunts impulsively just for a change of scenery. Constantly seeking out something new and stimulating, Sagittarians often have another goal in mind even before they accomplish the first. Sagittarius is naturally questioning and interested in the big picture, and can be quite philosophical or opinionated.
Planet: Jupiter; Element: Fire; Quality: Mutable; Color: Purple; Day: Thursday; Stone: Turquoise; Part of Body Ruled: Liver and hips; Motto: I philosophize; Energy: Yang
Your Personality Profile:
Although you possess considerable common sense, you do question accepted
rules. You are a seeker, yet your feet are on the ground. You want to create
your own destiny, and and bumps and bruises along the way simply contribute to
your growth, and you know it. Your emotions are up and down, although others may
not always see this until they know you well. Your nature is irrepressible, yet
you manage to earn others’ respect at the same time.
Determined – Spunky – Original
Robert Goulet, born November 26, 1933 Singer/Actor.
Tina Turner, born November 26, 1939 Singer.
Rich Little, born November 26, 1938 Comedian.
Charles Schulz, born November 26, 1922 Cartoonist.
Fixed Star(s) Near Your Sun:
Sun Conjunct Acrab
This fixed star has a Mars-Saturn influence, and suggests determinism, some
materialism, patience, and caution. Progress may be slow, and some financial
losses possible. You are adept at research, especially involving the uncovering
of secrets or the solving of mysteries.
Progressed Sun: Turning Points in the Life
We carry our Sun sign with us throughout our entire lives. If I’m a Sagittarius, I’ll always be a Sagittarius. However, in secondary progressions, the Sun “progresses” in a symbolic sense through our natal Sun sign, and then beyond it to subsequent signs. Secondary progressions are “a day for a year”, and because the Sun moves just under one degree per day, our Sun symbolically progresses just short of one degree every year of our lives. Because there are 30 degrees for every sign, if I were born in the latter days of a Sagittarius Sun, my Sun would progress to the sign of Capricorn in my early childhood, and to the sign of Aquarius in my early to mid-30’s. If I were born near the beginning of a Sagittarius Sun, however, my progressed Sun would enter Capricorn close to my 30th birthday, and to Aquarius in my late 50’s. The changeover of signs marks a critical turning point in a person’s life. At the very end of a sign (just before changing signs), individuals may make life-changing, impulsive decisions.
Your progressed Sun enters Capricorn at age 25. The ages of 24 to 26 mark a critical turning point in the development of your personality. You become more practical, mindful, and concerned about your personal security. You are a self-starter, and you become more shrewd and focused on your goals.
Your progressed Sun enters Aquarius at age 55. The ages of 54 to 56 mark a critical turning point in the development of your personality. After some sort of crisis of consciousness, and perhaps elimination of circumstances that have been limiting your growth, you become more humanitarian, somewhat detached, and independent. Some may become self-righteous and fixed during this phase, while others learn to detach themselves from situations and loosen up. You kick up your heels and enjoy life with a certain level of detachment and confidence that you hadn’t discovered before this time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What's your earliest memory of cycling?
Miguel Indurain winning the Tour de France . I was captivated by him winning five Tours in a row. I think I was watching the [1996] Tour on French Eurosport when he was going for a sixth title and he got dropped on the mountain and I remember the commentator shouting 'Indurain lâcher', meaning he'd been dropped.
And your first bike?
I had a Raleigh Chopper.
What's the last film you watched?
The last film I watched was, er … Oh, that one that was weird that had Keira Knightley in it ... you know, the one where they donate their organs ... what's it called? It was a book. You know, it was in a school and it all appeared fairly normal and then you realise ... 'Never Let Me Go', that's it.
Can you remember the first bike race you went to?
I think the first bike race I went to was when I was working for the BBC. I covered the very first international event at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome in Glasgow which was a round of the Track World Cup in 2012. That was the first live cycling event I had been to.
So, why the switch over to cycling?
Well, I always wanted to broaden out and be a general presenter rather than being an expert. Being the anchor is just a general broadcasting skill. I love, I think, all sports and I'm fascinated by them and so I just looked for opportunities to develop career-wise. I really enjoy cycling so when the opportunity came along in 2012 to do that – fortunately it went well – and now I've got a cycling gig with the BBC, I'm now doing the Winter Olympics and did the Paralympics for Channel 4.
For me it's not just about being into athletics and knowing about that sport as a pundit, but also being a broadcaster who can turn his hand to anything.
Are you finding the learning curve a steep one?
Absolutely. Because I have a love of cycling I'm just a sponge for any knowledge, so when I'm with these guys I just pester them for information. Obviously I want to improve my own cycling, I want to understand the sport better so that I can ask intelligent questions.
When we were doing Florence [for the road world championships] last September we had about eight or nine minutes to fill between the end of the men's time trial which Tony Martin won, and the medal presentation. For those moments I need to know what I'm talking about and have a whole reservoir of knowledge because otherwise I'd get to about three minutes and run out of questions. So, fortunately, despite Chris [Boardman] and I scraping the barrel, we did fill the time.
So yes, it's really important to be prepared for those moments when they say 'just keep talking'.
Any on-air cycling faux-pas that you'd care to share with us?

The recipients are honored by the NLG at special ceremonies at select Tour locations. How are the Naismith Legacy Award recipients determined? Unique among sports honors, most of which are granted annually after a competitive process, the NL Award is given on an ad-hoc basis, meaning not in regular or schedules timeframes. Recipients are nominated by a distinguished NL Nominating Committee, and then selected by the NL Board of Directors and Selection Committee for their role in furthering the values of fun, respect, integrity, honor and teamwork that Dr. Naismith wrote into the “Original Rules.” What are the details of the Naismith Legacy Award? The NL Award which stands about 2 ½ feet tall and weighs about 80 pounds features a specially commissioned 3 dimensional sculpture by Michael Roche of Dr. Naismith standing in the YMCA gym during the 1890’s. The work is based on photographs of Dr. Naismith and the YMCA gymnasium where he invented the basketball the winter of 1891. Renowned artist / sculptor Michael Roche, who specializes in highly detailed collectibles, created the sculpture, which bears the inscription: “In Recognition of the Invention of Basketball and a Life Lived with Honor” and a copy of the 13 rules he placed on the bulletin board etched on the back of award. Roche’s work includes some of the most prestigious clients, sports figures and unique artwork for any awards including, “gunslingers” golfers” and movie characters like Wizard of Oz and sports figures like, Old Tom Morris, Newt Rockne and legendary athlete Jim Thorpe.

What's unusual about this one is that the prime-time show it's based on is, itself, based on an earlier cartoon. The Addams Family came out of a series of panels by Charles Addams, which ran in The New Yorker for several decades, starting in 1937. The sitcom, which originally aired from 1964-66, was proving popular in syndicated reruns. Like I Dream of Jeannie and Batman, its characters were licensed by the Hanna-Barbera studio to guest-star on what was then their leading show, Scooby-Doo. The Scooby/Addams crossover appeared in 1972, and made such a hit, Hanna-Barbera produced a regular half-hour Addams Family Saturday morning series. The series debuted September 8, 1973, on NBC. Sanitized and satmornized, this series bore only a superficial resemblance to the creations of Charles Addams. It kept to the general theme of ghoulishness, but here, the macabre elements seemed more like a schtick than an outward expression of truly twisted souls. Their creepy old Victorian mansion was remodeled into a creepy old Victorian mansion-like vehicle, in which they traversed the land, getting involved in the lives of various people they met. And of course they had pets — tho at least they opted for an octopus rather than a puppy, and their cat was considerably larger and more obviously carnivorous than most. Lennie Weinrib ( Inch High, Private Eye; various voices in Smurfs ) provided the voice of Gomez Addams, and Janet Waldo ( Penelope Pitstop, Judy Jetson ) did that of Morticia. Jackie Coogan and Ted Cassidy repeated their roles from the live-action version. Another notable voice credit was Jodie Foster as Pugsley. This series lasted all of 13 episodes, each of which was aired over and over during the two years the network carried it. It's been re-run from time to time, most recently on Cartoon Network. It also spawned a comic book version, published by Gold Key, which began with an October, 1974 cover date and ended with #3, dated April, 1975. Hanna-Barbera produced a second Addams Family series, 1992-93, this one lasting 16 episodes. It resembled the original a little more closely, but with parent action groups still wielding some of their old power, still wasn't able to delve into the characters' true weirdness. Voice actors in this one included John Astin reprising his 1960s role as Gomez, with Nancy Linari (several voices in Sonic the Hedgehog and Duckman ) as Morticia, Jim Cummings ( Darkwing Duck, Tasmanian Devil ) as Lurch and Carol Channing ( Mehitabel, several voices in Where's Waldo?) as Granny. As robust as the Addams Family franchise is in live action — two TV series, a special, three movies, and endless syndicated reruns over a period of nearly four decades — both animated versions seem rather puny and insipid. The only cartoons that ever truly depicted The Addams Family are the ones drawn by Charles Addams himself. — DDM The Addams Family – EW.com Horror, Comedy We gave it a D+ In The Addams Family, these animated Addamses look and sound familiar — John Astin even does the voice of Gomez — but they completely lack the macabre charm of previous TV and movie versions. (In 1973, Hanna-Barbera produced a TV-cartoon Addams Family who were even more charmless than this.) In this new incarnation, the creepy family is drawn in bright colors, giving them an inappropriately perky look. Their spooky spirit is definitely missing; all that’s left is sadomasochistic sight gags and grossness worthy of the Garbage Pail Kids. For example, Fester blows his nose and says, ”I’ll save that for my collection.” Tune in to reruns of the original series or rent the movie on video instead.

tc_1635,Who was the only female victim to be killed off in the opening credit sequence in Police Squad?,Florence Henderson,"The show's opening sequence was a satire on traditional opening sequences of crime dramas at that time, and of the 1960s, particularly M Squad and various Quinn Martin shows such as The Fugitive and particularly The New Breed (which also starred Nielsen). Hank Simms, who had worked as an announcer for some of Quinn Martin's programs, announced the title of each episode, though the spoken title never matched the title caption.   The sequence introduces Nielsen and North as their characters during a shoot out,  as well as Abraham Lincoln impersonator Rex Hamilton, who dramatically returns gunfire to John Wilkes Booth. Hamilton never appeared in the show itself. 

Another recurring gag used in the opening sequence was the introduction of a ""special guest star"", a celebrity who was introduced but immediately murdered during the credits.  Lorne Greene, Georg Stanford Brown, Robert Goulet, William Shatner, Florence Henderson and William Conrad appeared as special guest stars during the show's run.    A scene with John Belushi, tied to blocks of concrete under water,  was filmed but replaced with footage of Henderson, due to Belushi's subsequent death before the episode was broadcast. Belushi's death came as a shock to Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker, as they had joked about it after he almost choked during the filming of the scene.  A list of possible celebrity death shots was included on the show's DVD release in 2006.","The context states that Florence Henderson was a special guest star who was introduced but immediately murdered during the credits. Additionally, it mentions that a scene with John Belushi was filmed but replaced with footage of Henderson due to his death.

Keep reading to find out more about the history of Nobel Peace Prizes here at the White House. What’s the Nobel Peace Prize? Alfred Nobel was a man of many disciplines -- including science, invention, entrepreneurship, literature, and peace. When he passed away in 1896, he dedicated his will to award those who have been outstanding figures in these fields. As a result, in 1900, the Nobel Foundation was established and became the organization responsible for awarding the Nobel Prizes. According to Alfred Nobel’s will, the Nobel Peace Prize shall be awarded to those who have “done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses."" The Nobel Peace Prize is an international award that is awarded every year by the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The prize ceremony takes place annually on December 10, the date on which Alfred Nobel passed away. The prize usually includes a medal, personal diploma, and award money. Woodrow Wilson's Nobel Peace Prize Medal. Picture provided by the Library of Congress. Which Presidents and Vice Presidents have won a Nobel Prize? Our story starts in 1906 when Theodore Roosevelt became the first President to win a Nobel Peace Prize. Since then, three other Presidents and one Vice President have received the honor. Below is a list of recipients from the White House: President Woodrow Wilson in 1920, for his efforts in ending the First World War and help in creating the League of Nations. President Jimmy Carter in 2002, for his efforts in finding “peaceful solutions to international conflicts, advancing democracy and human rights, and promoting economic and social development.” Vice President Al Gore in 2007, for his efforts to obtain and spread knowledge about climate change. President Barack Obama in 2009, for his efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation. When President Obama accepted the prestigious award in 2009, he humbly highlighted his surprise in receiving the honor: I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the considerable controversy that your generous decision has generated. In part, this is because I am at the beginning, and not the end, of my labors on the world stage.

Historic Roots
Jackie Joyner-Kersee was born Jacqueline Joyner to parents Mary and Alfred Joyner on March 3, 1962. Jackie recalls in her autobiography that at the time she was born, John Kennedy was president and her paternal grandmother stated to her mother, ""if it's a girl, name her Jacqueline because she'll be the first lady of something"" (Joyner-Kersee and Steptoe 1997, 12). Jackie's grandmother was speaking a prophetic word that would be realized in her life.
In her autobiography, Joyner-Kersee describes humble beginnings. Jackie's parents were very young when they married. Her mother, Mary, was sixteen when Jackie's older brother Al was born. She was eighteen when she gave birth to Jackie. Jackie, her parents, paternal grandmother, and three siblings shared a home in East St. Louis, Illinois. Sometimes, in the winter the furnace would break down and Jackie's parents would heat the house with the oven. Another casualty of winter was the water pipes bursting. Jackie and her family saved jugs of water in the event of this happening and they heated the water on the stove to bathe and wash dishes (Joyner-Kersee and Steptoe 1997). Jackie grew up in a neighborhood that had strong community ties yet was plagued with violence. Her parents did their best to shelter and protect their family (Ibid.).

Sampras competes against best -- ever
By Larry Schwartz
His opponents aren't Agassi, Rafter and Rios. They are Laver, Rosewall and Emerson.
Pete Sampras isn't playing for today; he's competing for history.
 
Pete Sampras needs to win on the clay of the French Open to be considered the best ever.
When he won his sixth Wimbledon championship in 1999, it gave him 12 Grand Slam singles titles, tying Roy Emerson ior most majors all time.
Though he had earned more than $35 million in ATP Tour earnings going into 1999, it is Grand Slams that consume him. The easy-going, hard-hitting Sampras would trade a dozen of his 55 Tour victories (through 1998) for one French Open or another Australian. Let others play for money; he's playing for majors.
""I measure my year on how I do at the majors and the more that I have won over the years, the more I want to win,"" Sampras said. ""I don't look at myself as a historical icon, but the reality of it is, yeah, I am playing for history now.""
Sampras, 27, is not the indifferent jock he pretends to be. While he gives the impression that he doesn't play with a passion, he deeply wants to be remembered as the best ever. ""I don't think it's arrogant,"" Sampras said. ""I'm not ashamed that I feel that I can actually do it.""
Yet, he is uncomfortable in the spotlight. He is a throwback to the days when gentleman played the sport of tennis. ""I could be a jerk and get a lot more publicity, but that's not who I am,"" said Sampras, who believes in the past, but came of age in the 1990s.
Although Sampras is tied with Emerson for the Slams record, he was taught to emulate Rod Laver, the winner of two Grand Slams, 11 majors, and generally regarded as the game's greatest.
""There wasn't an American that I really idolized,"" Sampras said. ""Sure, I respected (John) McEnroe's talent and (Jimmy) Connors' intensity, but the Aussies, those guys were great guys."" And the players he admired most were the gentlemanly Laver and Ken Rosewall.
Since 1993, when he first claimed the No. 1 ranking, the 6-foot-1 Sampras has stood head and shoulders above his playing opponents. While he has a ferocious forehand and sensational serve, his greatest gift may be his will to win. He's not afraid to leave his guts on the courts -- literally.
He was born Aug. 12, 1971 in Washington, D.C., and grew up in Palos Verdes, Cal. His father, Soterios, called Sam, was an aerospace engineer for the Department of Defense and his mother, Georgia, was a homemaker.
He began playing tennis at seven and when he was nine, his father asked Pete Fischer, a physician and amateur player, to hit with his son. Fischer was so impressed with the youngster's ability, he became his coach.
When Sampras was 11, he had the opportunity to trade groundstrokes with Laver, his idol. ""Pete was so nervous he couldn't get the ball over the net,"" Fischer said.
Sampras rarely won a major junior tournament. Fischer believed his protege needed to play ""up"" in age groups, against stronger and older players to develop his all-around game. ""From the very beginning, the competition was always Laver,"" Sampras said.
At 14, Fischer changed Sampras' backhand from two-handed to one-handed. He also switched him from a safe defensive baseliner to a classic risky serve-and-volleyer. ""I played just like (Michael) Chang, grinding from the baseline,"" Sampras said. ""When I started serving and volleying, I became much more laid back.""
Fischer told him that someday these changes would help him win Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.
[...]","The context explicitly states that Pete Sampras did not win the French Open during his career, as it mentions his desire to win on clay to be considered the best ever and that he never achieved a victory at the French Open. This aligns with the answer provided.",53,1,1,1,1,1

Fredriksson earned his first Olympic medals at the 1948 London Games, winning gold in the 1,000- and 10,000-meter kayak singles. His margin of victory in the 10,000 -- 30.5 seconds -- is the largest in the sport, according to the International Olympic Committee.

Webopedia Definition email fax Spam is considered to be electronic junk mail or junk newsgroup postings. Some people define spam even more generally as any unsolicited email . However, if a long-lost brother finds your email address and sends you a message, this could hardly be called spam, even though it is unsolicited. Real spam is generally email advertising for some product sent to a mailing list or newsgroup . Why is it Called Spam? There is some debate about the source of the term, but the generally accepted version is that it comes from the Monty Python song, ""Spam spam spam spam, spam spam spam spam, lovely spam, wonderful spam"". Like the song, spam is an endless repetition of worthless text. Another school of thought maintains that it comes from the computer group lab at the University of Southern California who gave it the name because it has many of the same characteristics as the lunch meat Spam: Nobody wants it or ever asks for it. No one ever eats it; it is the first item to be pushed to the side when eating the entree. Sometimes it is actually tasty, like 1% of junk mail that is really useful to some people. The term spam can also be used to describe any ""unwanted"" email from a company or website -- typically at some point a user would have agreed to receive the email via subscription list opt-in -- a newer term called graymail is used to describe this particular type of spam. Why Spam is a Problem In addition to wasting people's time with unwanted email, spam also eats up a lot of network bandwidth . Consequently, there are many organizations, as well as individuals, who have taken it upon themselves to fight spam with a variety of techniques. But because the Internet is public, there is really little that can be done to prevent spam, just as it is impossible to prevent junk mail. However, some online services have instituted policies to prevent spammers from spamming their subscribers. See also phishing , a type of email scam that is used to fraudulently obtain personal information or details of your online accounts. Related Articles What is spam? What is spam? More information Definitions The term ""spam"" is Internet slang that refers to unsolicited commercial email (UCE) or unsolicited bulk email (UBE). Some people refer to this kind of communication as junk email to equate it with the paper junk mail that comes through the US Mail. Unsolicited email most often contains advertisements for services or products, but very few reputable marketers use UCE to advertise. The most commonly seen spam includes the following: Phishing scams, a very popular and dangerous form of email fraud Foreign bank scams or advance fee fraud schemes Pyramid schemes, including multilevel marketing (MLM) Other ""Get Rich Quick"" or ""Make Money Fast"" (MMF) schemes Quack health products and remedies Ads for pornographic websites Offers of software for collecting email addresses and sending UCE Offers of bulk emailing services for sending UCE Chain letters (see About chain mail ) Illegally pirated software (""Warez"") Back to top How spammers operate Unlike junk paper mail, email spam costs the sender very little to send; almost all of the costs are paid by the recipient and the carriers, because the spammer does not have to pay for all the Internet bandwidth tied up in the delivery of the spam. Because they have no incentive to be efficient in their mass emailing, spammers usually don't put much effort into verifying email addresses; they use automatic programs called bots to scour the web and Usenet newsgroups, collecting addresses, or buy them in bulk from other companies. Spammers also guess at addresses using name generation programs, and even send thousands of messages that bounce. In order to get a single response, spammers are willing to send out a thousand email messages or ten thousand; it makes very little difference to them.","The context defines spam as unsolicited email or electronic junk mail, including various forms of unwanted messages across different platforms.

Blondie in the 80s
Blondie were a firm favourite in our household back in the seventies and eighties, and I still have a stack of well-used vinyl - the band gained fame in the late 1970s. Featuring lead singer Deborah Harry, the American band was a pioneer in the early American punk rock and New Wave scene. Indeed, their first two albums were very much influenced by punk and new wave, and were more successful in the UK and Australia, than in America. 
After the release of Parallel Lines in 1978, Blondie were no longer seen as an underground band in the US, and over the next few years, the band achieved many hit singles. 
New musical styles such as disco, reggae and pop were incorporated into the band's releases, while still retaining some of the new wave/punk element.
After the release of their sixth studio album The Hunter. Blondie split in 1982, with Debbie Harry starting a moderately successful solo career, her biggest hit being I Want That Man. However, the band reformed in 1997 and acheived renewed chart success with the No.1 single Maria in the UK in 1999. 
Deborah Harry has also released five solo albums, her biggest being Def, Dumb and Blonde in 1989. Harry changed her name from ""Debbie"" to ""Deborah"", although I'm not sure why - maybe she just wanted to sound a bit posh!

DENIS (1978)
Denis was originally a hit for Randy & The Rainbows in 1963. Blondie's version reached No.2 in the UK in 1978, and was kept off the top spot by Kate Bush with Wuthering Heights.
""PICTURE THIS"" (1978)
This was the first single to be lifted from Blondie's third album Parallel Lines and reached No.12 in the UK singles chart in 1978. The single was not released in the U.S. In the promotional video (see the playlist above) Debbie Harry is wearing a yellow dress designed by Stephen Sprouse. The fashion designer pioneered sixties-inspired, neon and graffiti print clothing that has a sophisticated style.
The B-side, Fade Away and Radiate was also included on Parallel Lines and featured Robert Fripp on guitar.
""CALL ME"" (1980)
Reaching No.1 in 1980, Call Me was the main soundtrack to the movie American Gigolo.  The song spent six weeks at the top in both the U.S. and Canada, and  this was the fourth #1 single for the band in the UK. The song also  featured on the British Telecom advert during 1980.
Electronic/disco  music producer Giorgio Moroder originally asked Stevie Nicks from  Fleetwood Mac to create the soundtrack, but she declined.
There have been literally dozens of cover versions of Call Me, the most notable ones being by The Dandy Warhols on their 2004 album Come On Feel The Dandy Warhols. Also, Tina  Arena (remember her?) on the 2008 album Songs Of Love & Loss II (this was a unique swing version) and by Scottish band Franz Ferdinand  on the War Child Charity Album after a request by Blondie themselves.
The only 80s cover version I know of is by the American band Until December, which featured on their self-titled studio album. The image is the single cover from the German version of Call Me.
""ATOMIC"" (1980)
The driving bass-line in Atomic makes this my joint favourite Blondie track along with the previous single Call Me. It was the third single to be released from Blondie's fourth studio album Eat To The Beat, and reached #1 in the UK for two weeks on 1st March 1980. The single was actually a remix of the 4:35 album version.
Eat To The Beat made #1 in the UK album charts and #17 in the US. This is Blondie's  most-loved album and regarded by many as a step-up from the previous  album Parallel Lines. It features the perfect blend of 80s new wave,  punk, catchy pop and a beautiful ballad called Shayla. Add the quality drumming of Clem Burke and you end up with one of the finest albums ever released.
Parallel Lines also made #1 in the UK, as did the previous single Call Me.
""The Tide Is High"" (1980)
The first single to be taken from the Autoamerican album, this reached No.1 in 1980. My gran actually bought this on 7"" vinyl for my 12th birthday, and the song's reggae-inspired vibe is hard not to like at almost any age.
I did not know this at the time, but the song is actually a cover that was originally penned in 1967 by Tyrone Evans and John Holt and was performed by The Paragons, a ska and rocksteady group from Jamaica fronted by Holt.
[...]","The context mentions that ""Island of Lost Souls"" was the band's last proper single release of the 80s and peaked at #39, which meant that ""Island of Lost Souls"" was the band's last major hit single, until the release of ""Maria"" in 1999.

Ohio could be a major player beyond the ballot box alone in 2016. The biggest cities in Ohio, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Columbus, are all making a push to lure the GOP Party to present its 2016 presidential candidate there. Cleveland and Columbus also competed for the chance to host the 2016 Democratic convention before Philadelphia landed it.
If they succeed, it means that these cities will earn a greater share of the spotlight in 2015 and 2016. Here are some things you need to know about them and how they help define the identity of the Buckeye State:

1. Columbus: The Arch City is the state capital and also Ohio's most heavily populated city. It is the third largest Midwestern city in the United States with a population of 822,553 according to 2013 estimates. Columbus is home to the Ohio State University, which is the state's flagship institution of higher education. It is also a noted hub for independent art.
2. Cleveland: On the shores of Lake Erie, Cleveland is a destination for legions of music lovers. It houses the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, a museum that showcases the history of that music genre along with notable past and present rock and roll musicians. Cleveland is also the birthplace of Standard Oil. John D. Rockefeller founded his company there in 1870. It has remained an important manufacturing center since that time.
3. Cincinnati: The third largest city in Ohio was the first American city founded after the Revolutionary War, in 1788. Less than a century later, it earned the distinction of being the first place to establish a pro baseball team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, in 1869. Cincinnati was once known as the Paris of America because of historic architecture dating back to the 1800s.
VOTE NOW: Should the Government Be Doing More to Promote Tourism in America?
4. Toledo: The Glass City earned its namesake after it emerged as the center of the glass industry in the early 20th century. Many large glass companies started in Toledo and the Toledo Museum of Art houses a collection of all different types of glass. The city became iconic in popular culture as a result of the TV Series M*A*S*H* in the 1970s and early 1980s. Corporal Maxwell Klinger, played by actor Jaime Farr, was a Toledo resident in the series before being drafted into the Korean War.
5. Akron: Much like the glass industry defined Toledo, the rubber industry has defined Akron. Ohio's fifth largest city became the Rubber Capital of the World in the early 20th century after several large tire companies set up headquarters and opened manufacturing plants within the city. Akron has had an influence on what people eat for breakfast as well as transportation. The forerunner to the Quaker Oats Company, F. Schumacher Milling Company, was founded in Akron in the 1880s.

Anne Bancroft | Film | The Guardian Anne Bancroft Wednesday 8 June 2005 07.09 EDT First published on Wednesday 8 June 2005 07.09 EDT Close This article is 11 years old After a youthful flirtation with television, a near-disastrous relationship with Hollywood and a failed marriage, the actor Anne Bancroft, who has died aged 73, fled the west coast and returned home to New York. It was 1959 and in her own words ""life was a shambles ... I was terribly immature. I was going steadily downhill in terms of self-respect and dignity"". She needed to reclaim her life and career. Happily, it worked and within three years she had won Tonys for her Broadway roles in Two for the Seesaw and as Annie Sullivan in The Miracle Worker. When the latter was transferred to the screen by its author William Gibson and director Arthur Penn, she again took the demanding role of Helen Keller's teacher, winning the best actress Oscar in 1963. This success relaunched her career, leading to prestige roles in the theatre including Mother Courage, Sister Jeanne in The Devils and Regina Giddens in The Little Foxes. There were film roles too, in The Pumpkin Eater (1964) and, most famously, as the seductive Mrs Robinson in the modish and popular The Graduate (1967). This movie, in which Dustin Hoffman made his screen debut, became so closely associated with Bancroft as a 1960s archetype that it somewhat obscured her subsequent career. She was also famously married to the Jewish actor-director Mel Brooks whose mother, told that he was going to marry an Italian-American Catholic, replied ""bring the girl over, I'll be in the kitchen - with my head in the oven"". Despite these and other comments about a mis-match, the marriage proved one of the most stable in show business. It was also creative, and Brooks served as executive producer on movies in which Bancroft excelled, including The Elephant Man (1980) and the two-hander 84 Charing Cross Road (1986). These and other films made for his own company redeemed his often frantic comedies, three of which involved Bancroft. In Silent Movie (1976) she - among other stars - glamorously played herself as a highlight of the film. Sadly, she was less well served when co-starring opposite Brooks in his lumpen remake of the Ernst Lubitsch classic To Be or Not to Be (1983) and by her cameo appearance in his dire spoof Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995). Bancroft was born in the Bronx to a working class family. It was the height of the depression, but even when her father became unemployed in the late 1930s, Anna was allowed tap dancing lessons, then enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Her graduation piece was seen by the actress Frances Fuller, who recommended the 18 year old for television work. Bancroft debuted as Anne Marno in The Torrents of Spring and when a popular radio show The Goldbergs transferred to television she became a member of the TV family, working steadily for two years. Having helped a fellow actor with a screen test, it was Bancroft who got the call from 20th Century Fox offering a $20,000-a-year contract. It was to prove a mixed blessing. Under her new name Anne Bancroft she made her movie debut in Don't Bother to Knock, made in 1952 but held up for a year. Within five years she made 15 films, as various as Demetrius and the Gladiators, a baseball movie The Kid from Left Field and Gorilla at Large (1954). There were several routine westerns, modest thrillers including Jacques Tourneur's Nightfall, plus the dismal The Girl in Black Silk Stockings (1957). By this time she admitted to over indulging in alcohol and being unhappily married to someone ""who calls himself an actor but whose real occupation is playing a rich boy"". She was also in psychoanalysis. The road back involved work with a vocal coach, regular attendance at The Actors Studio and study with Herbert Berghof. Plus three sessions a week with her therapist. Then came a triumphant return to acting, playing first opposite a difficult Henry Fonda, followed by the explosive and physically demanding role in The Miracle Worker. When the film version was announced, the backers wanted either Elizabeth Taylor or Audrey Hepburn, but Penn refused and budgeted it at only $500,000, shooting in New Jersey. At 31 Bancroft became an Oscar winner and in the words of one critic, ""she left Hollywood a failure and returned a star"".","The context explicitly states that Anne Bancroft was born in 1931, which falls within the 1930s decade of the 20th century.

Cindy Crawford's son Presley is the spitting image of her and he has the looks to boot | Daily Mail Online comments Her daughter has her incredible good looks and it seems that Cindy Crawford's son Presley has also inherited her model genes too. The supermodel and her 13-year-old son were seen out and about in Malibu on Thursday and the family resemblance was quite clear. Aside from his bright blonde hair, Presley displayed Cindy's great cheekbones as well as a similar nose and mouth. He's got her good looks too! Cindy Crawford was seen with her son Presley in Malibu on Thurday. The 13-year-old is the spitting image of his mother Model in the making: As well as inheriting Cindy's model looks, Presley is also willowy like his father There's little doubt that should the teen want to make a career out of modelling he would have no problems, except perhaps opposition from his mother. Cindy put the breaks on her daughter Kaia's modelling career until she is older. Last year she said: 'At this point, she’s too young to pursue a career. 'There aren’t even a handful of jobs for a 10-year-old girl. 'But if she’s 17 and wants to try it… of course, what can I say?' The young beauty, who is now 11, made her editorial debut for Young Versace last year. Cindy had Presley and Kaia with husband Rande Gerber, whom she married in 1998. Cindy herself quit modelling back in 2000, before making a return to the industry on the cover of Vogue Mexico in 2011. Making the pavement her runway: The 46-year-old beauty looked effortlessly fabulous And speaking recently about the current biggest issues in the modelling world, Cindy said: 'You know, I don't know. I'm not still in the trenches right now. But if you make too many rules - like, ""You can't work this many hours"" - it doesn't work, because sometimes you have to. 'Sometimes you have to get up early or be prepared to do the job in the freezing cold. 'I think that, again though, models have to have a voice and speak up for themselves, every day, on the job... People have to respect each other. And if you're working with someone who doesn't respect you, then leave.' It runs in the family: Cindy's daughter Kaia has also dabbled in modelling, although her mother has said she wants her to wait until she is older before pursuing it as a full-time career Still as in love as ever: Cindy and her husband Randy Gerber have been married since 1998 Cindy Crawford - Biography - IMDb Cindy Crawford Biography Showing all 71 items Jump to: Overview (4) | Mini Bio (1) | Spouse (2) | Trade Mark (5) | Trivia (37) | Personal Quotes (22) Overview (4) 5' 9"" (1.75 m) Mini Bio (1) Cindy Crawford was born on February 20, 1966 in DeKalb, Illinois, USA as Cynthia Ann Crawford.

Princess Diana's dresses for sale 02:21
Story highlights
Dress worn by Diana to dance with John Travolta sells for $362,424
A total of 10 dresses owned by the late Princess of Wales sells for $1.2 million
Outfits were worn at state occasions, on official visits and for portraits
Entire collection was auctioned in London
Sumptuous velvet, delicate sequins, intricate beading: They are dresses fit for a princess -- Princess Diana, that is -- and if you've got a big pocketbook (with a designer label, naturally), they could have been yours.
Ten dresses worn by the late Princess of Wales went under the hammer at Kerry Taylor Auctions in London on Tuesday.
The top seller was the midnight blue number Diana famously wore to dance with John Travolta at a gala dinner at the White House in November 1985. That dress sold for $362,424 (240,000 British pounds) and was bought by ""a British gentleman as a surprise to cheer up his wife,"" the auction house said.
The entire collection fetched $1.2 million (800,000 British pounds), the auctioneer said.
TV footage and photographs of the princess and the Hollywood star gliding around the room to the music of ""Saturday Night Fever"" were seen around the world, and Travolta later described the experience as having been ""like a fairy tale.""
Diana also wore the ""Travolta"" dress, designed by Victor Edelstein , for her final portrait by Lord Snowdon in 1997.
Auctioneer Kerry Taylor told CNN before the auction that putting a price on such items was ""difficult,"" but that their high profile added value.
Rare photo of teenage Diana sold for $18,369
""You can look at what they sold for, you can look at how simple the thing is,"" she explained. ""If it was worn on a state occasion, or if it was for a private dinner, are there photographs of the princess wearing it, are there film reels of the princess wearing it, and is there a human story that adds to it?""
For example, as Taylor pointed out, a bottle green velvet evening dress, also by Victor Edelstein, bears what could be the traces of a young prince: ""what looks like a little boy's (or little child's) handprint -- sticky fingerprints on the fabric."" The dress sold for $36,281, including the buyer's premium.
Also included in the sale were dresses by some of Diana's other favorite designers. Six werer by Catherine Walker , including the beaded black dress Diana wore for Vanity Fair 's 1997 photoshoot by Mario Testino -- that sold for $163,264 -- and the black Bruce Oldfield gown she wore to the gala opening of ""Les Miserables"" in October 1985 and for another official portrait by Snowdon. That dress sold for $76,190.
The outfits were originally sold in a charity auction at Christie's in New York in June 1997, just months before Diana's death in a Paris car crash in August of that year. Kerry says that despite the passing of the years, the princess remains hugely popular.
""Diana was different,"" she said. ""She was very much a 'people's princess' and the ups and downs of her life, her loves, people followed them avidly. I think there will always be a special place in people's hearts for Diana.""
Taylor also auctioned off the skimpy mesh dress worn by the Duchess of Cambridge -- then known as Kate Middleton -- during a fashion show at the University of St. Andrews, at which she is reputed to have attracted the attentions of her future husband, Prince William.","The context explicitly mentions that the dress worn by Diana to dance with John Travolta, which sold for $362,424 and was the top seller, was designed by Victor Edelstein. Additionally, it states that this gown garnered the highest bid at Christie's Diana dress auction.",39,1,1,1,1,1

BBC News | World | Spencers agree �2m divorce settlement Wednesday, December 3, 1997 Published at 15:54 GMT World Spencers agree �2m divorce settlement Earl Spencer told court there was no hope of any reconciliation in the marriage The final chapter in the turbulent eight-year marriage of Earl and Countess Spencer has closed after the pair divorced in a South African courtroom. The Countess will receive a lump sum settlement of �1,815,000 by February 1998, according to court documents, a house in Cape Town and joint custody of their four children, plus maintenance payments. Charles Spencer will make up any shortfall between the price of the pair's house and �250,000, in the event of his wife emigrating from South Africa and selling the property. The guarantee takes the total settlement past �2m. The Spencers also undertook not to give any details of their married life, private life or financial affairs to the media. The final order was granted by Mr Justice Farlam at the end of a six-minute hearing in which Earl Spencer admitted his marriage had irretrievably broken down. It follows an announcement on Monday by Earl Spencer, 33, and his 32-year-old estranged wife that they had reached an undisclosed financial settlement. Both parties agreed to withdraw allegations made against each other during last week's acrimonious battle to decide whether the case ought to be heard in South Africa or Britain. 'It's so broken down' During the short hearing, the brother of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, was asked if there was any hope of a reconciliation. The Earl replied: ""There is not, my lord."" And when he was asked if the marriage had irretrievably broken down, he said: ""It's so broken down, my lord."" The judge then agreed to the ending of the marriage after Lady Spencer's legal team made no representations. She was not in court for the hearing. He then left the court and the Earl and his legal team walked through the corridors of Cape Town's High Court into the bright sunshine, where they were followed by waiting photographers. Countess Spencer was not in court to hear the divorce settlement But he walked straight into his lawyer's chambers 100 yards up the road without commenting. Attention is now likely to focus on whether either of them will re-marry as Cape Town pharmacist Guy Woods is reported to have already proposed to Lady Spencer. On the eve of the final settlement, the Earl appeared with his latest girlfriend Josie Borain at a fashion dinner in Cape Town. He had contested Lady Spencer's demands for a clean break settlement of �3.75m despite having a personal fortune of �6m and annual pre-tax income of �1m. The Earl's legal team said his fortune was tied up in the Althorp Estate and family estates in Guernsey and London. Marriage soon in trouble The settlement was reached just before Lady Spencer, her father John, and the Earl's former mistress Chantal Collopy, 37, were due to give evidence against him. The hearing ended the often bitter courtroom battle which revealed lurid details about the couple's private lives. When the couple married in 1989, the prospects seemed rosy for Lord Spencer and Victoria Lockwood, an international model. But the marriage was soon in trouble and the Earl resumed an affair with cartoonist Sally-Ann Lasson within months of his marriage. Move was temporary Despite the birth of their four children, the situation worsened and Lady Spencer, was finding it difficult to cope and went to a Surrey clinic for treatment for anorexia and alcoholism. The couple split in May 1995 and moved to South Africa just before Christmas with the Earl saying a prime reason was to avoid media intrusion. They both said they intended to return to Britain in the future, the Earl because the Althorp ancestral home needed his ""permanent presence"", and Lady Spencer because she said it was always intended as a temporary move.","The context explicitly states that the final chapter of the marriage was closed after the pair divorced in a South African courtroom, and the case was heard in South Africa. The context also mentions that the couple moved to South Africa to avoid media intrusion and that the divorce was finalized in a South African court.",37,1,1,1,1,1

Mohamed Al-Fayed, the former owner of Harrods, ... - LONDON: Mohamed Al-Fayed, the former owner ... called the endorsements a ""curse"" on the luxury department store. Al-Fayed sells London icon store, Harrods to another Arab family for £1.5bn | African News - Nigeria News - African Politics Twitter Mohammed al Fayed Harrods, the world famous department store, has been sold for more than £1.5bn to the Qatari royal family, Times Online can confirm. Mohamed al-Fayed, the Egyptian owner of the London landmark, has decided to retire and will hand over the reins to Qatar Holding. The firm was chosen because they would “maintain the traditions of Harrods”, said Ken Costa, chairman of Lazard International – the investment bank advising the family entrusted with the deal. Fayed received advances from Gulf-based suitors in the last two months, but initially offered them “two fingers” in a vehement refusal. “People approach us from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar. Fair enough, but I put two fingers up to them all,” Fayed said last month. “It is not for sale. This is not Marks & Spencer or Sainsbury. It is a special place that gives people pleasure. There is only one Mecca.” But today Costa confirmed that the owner of Fulham football club has changed his mind. “After 25 years as chairman of Harrods, Mohamed al-Fayed has decided to retire and to spend more time with his children and grandchildren,” Costa said. Costa said Fayed’s family trust agreed to sell because Qatar Holding had “both the vision and financial capacity” to support the long-term growth of Harrods. Fayed “wished to ensure that the legacy and traditions that he has built up in Harrods would be continued”, he added. The Egyptian has invested around £400m in the Knightsbridge icon to restore it to its former glory, including £75m for an Egyptian-themed escalator flanked by sphinxes. Qatar Holding, which handles investments for the Middle Eastern state’s royals, will become only the fifth owner of Harrods since its creation in 1840. The store has  been owned by the Egyptian tycoon since 1985’, is thought to have changed hands in a secret deal with Gulf-based investment group Qatar Holding, which is owned by the Qatari royal family. Sources speaking to Sky News said the department store had sold for £1.5 billion. It comes after it emerged that Mr al Fayed had received an unsolicited approach for Harrods in March. At the time Mr al Fayed, who also owns Fulham Football Club, tried to reassure staff that the store in London’s Knightsbridge area was not for sale. Harrods, which is one of the world’s most famous stores and extends over seven floors, sees more than 15 million customers pass through its doors each year. Harrods was bought by Fayed in 1985 for £615 million. The retailer has been regularly linked to takeover speculation . In 2002 John Ritblat, then-chairman of British Land, offered to buy Harrods from Mr Fayed and lease it back to him. However the offer was rejected by Mr Fayed, who told Ritblat – who was knighted in 2006 – that the store was not for sale. In 2003, it was suggested that Mr Fayed wanted to put the store on the market. It was linked to Harvey Nichols’ owner Dickson Poon and investment bank Lazards, which was reported to be working on a deal to merge Harrods with Selfridges, the rival department store. A spokesman for Harrods was not immediately available to comment on the reports that the store had now been sold, but a statement is expected to be made on Saturday confirming the deal. Ken Costa, the chairman of Lazard International, the investment bank advising the deal, confirmed the sale to Sky News. In a statement he said: “After 25 years as chairman of Harrods, Mohamed al Fayed has decided to retire and to spend more time with his children and grandchildren. He has built Harrods into a unique luxury brand with worldwide recognition. In reaching the decision to retire, he wishes to ensure that the legacy and traditions that he has built up in Harrods would be continued, and that the team that he has built up would be encouraged to develop the foundations that he has laid. Qatar Holding (QH) will become only the fifth owner of Harrods since its creation, in 1840. Qatar Holding was specifically chosen by the Trust as they had both the vision and financial capacity to support the long-term successful growth of Harrods. Of paramount importance to Mohamed al Fayed was to ensure that the Harrods staff would find in QH an owner who would be supportive of their efforts to maintain the traditions of Harrods.” Sources: Telegraph /Times Al-Fayed says he torched Harrods royal warrants - Daily News Egypt Al-Fayed says he torched Harrods royal warrants - Daily News Egypt Thursday January 19, 2017 Jobzella Email Al-Fayed says he torched Harrods royal warrants LONDON: Mohamed Al-Fayed, the former owner of Harrods, said Sunday he had the plush London emporium’s royal warrants taken down and burned. The Egyptian tycoon, in a letter to The Sunday Telegraph newspaper, called the endorsements a ""curse"" on the luxury department store. A royal warrant allows a supplier to advertise that they are used by the royal family. The Harrods warrants were from Queen Elizabeth II, her husband Prince Philip, queen Elizabeth the queen mother and Prince Charles. ""I ordered their removal. Later, I had them burned. They were a curse and business tripled following their removal,"" Al-Fayed said. The royal warrants were removed from Harrods in 2000. Al-Fayed has consistently attacked the royal family with a variety of claims since the death of his son Dodi Fayed and Diana, princess of Wales in a Paris car crash in 1997. In May, Al-Fayed sold Harrods to the investment arm of Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund. No figure was given. In his letter, Al-Fayed called for the Qataris to keep two memorials to Diana and his son, which are located in the store. They are a statue of the two dancing together and a wine glass smudged with the princess’s lipstick from her last dinner before the crash. ""Unless and until this country gives the princess the thanks and devotion she deserves in the form of a fitting public memorial, this statue, ‘Innocent Victims’, should remain to remind the world of what was lost when two young people were on the brink of happiness together, were killed,"" he said. ""It is the only memorial to the princess in the country, if one discounts the misconceived municipal waterworks in Hyde Park that every year causes casualties among the children who slip over when paddling in it.""","The context explicitly states that Mohamed Al-Fayed was born in Bakos, Alexandria, Egypt, which directly answers the question about his birthplace in North Africa.",28,1,1,1,1,1
tc_1944,Aung San Suu Kyi is a controversial leader in which country?,Myanmar,"Aung San Suu Kyi tells UN that the term 'Rohingya' will be avoided | World news | The Guardian Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi tells UN that the term 'Rohingya' will be avoided Myanmar leader reiterates her stance that the word, used to describe a persecuted Muslim minority, is ‘controversial’ and her government won’t use it A mother – in a camp for Rohingya in Sittwe – Myanmar, holds onto her twins, both of whom suffer from malnutrition. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Reuters Close This article is 7 months old Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has told the UN special rapporteur on human rights that the government will avoid using the term “Rohingya” to describe a persecuted Muslim minority in the country’s north-west. The statement came as the top UN human rights official issued a report saying the Rohingya had been deprived of nationality and undergone systematic discrimination and severe restrictions on movements. They had also suffered executions and torture that together may amount to crimes against humanity, the report said. 'No Muslims allowed': how nationalism is rising in Aung San Suu Kyi's Myanmar Read more Members of the group of about 1.1 million people, who identify themselves by the term Rohingya, are seen by many Myanmar Buddhists as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. The term is a divisive issue. The UN human rights investigator, Yanghee Lee, met Aung San Suu Kyi in the capital Naypyitaw on her first trip to Myanmar since the Nobel Peace Prize winner took power in April. “At their meeting here this morning, our foreign minister Daw Aung San Suu Kyi explained our stance on this issue that the controversial terms should be avoided,” said Aung Lin, the permanent secretary at the ministry of foreign affairs. Aung San Suu Kyi is banned from presidency by the military-drafted constitution because her children have British citizenship. She holds offices of the state counsellor and the minister for foreign affairs, but is the de facto leader of the administration. Feted in the west for her role as champion of Myanmar’s democratic opposition during long years of military rule and house arrest, Suu Kyi has been criticised overseas , and by some in Myanmar, for saying little about the abuses faced by the Rohingya. Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, UN high commissioner for human rights said in the report the Rohingya were excluded from a number of professions and needed special paperwork to access hospitals, which has resulted in delays and deaths of babies and their mothers during childbirth. It was the first time Zeid said these and other long-standing violations could add up to crimes against humanity, an international crime. Crimes against humanity are serious, widespread and systematic violations. Some 120,000 Rohingya remain displaced in squalid camps since fighting erupted in Rakhine State between Buddhists and Muslims in 2012. Thousands have fled persecution and poverty. “The new Government has inherited a situation where laws and policies are in place that are designed to deny fundamental rights to minorities, and where impunity for serious violations against such communities has encouraged further violence against them,” Zeid said. Reversing such discrimination must be a priority for the new government “to halt ongoing violations and prevent further ones taking place against Myanmar’s ethnic and religious minorities,” Zeid said. Aung San Suu Kyi has formed a committee to “bring peace and development” to the state in May, but its plans are not clear. No vote, no candidates: Myanmar's Muslims barred from their own election Read more","The context explicitly mentions Aung San Suu Kyi as a leader in Myanmar, highlighting her role in the country's political processes and her interactions with the government.

Storyline
At the beginning of the twentieth century, Jews and Orthodox Christians live in the little village of Anatevka in the pre-revolutionary Russia of the Czars. Among the traditions of the Jewish community, the matchmaker arranges the match and the father approves it. The milkman Reb Tevye is a poor man that has been married for twenty-five years with Golde and they have five daughters. When the local matchmaker Yente arranges the match between his older daughter Tzeitel and the old widow butcher Lazar Wolf, Tevye agrees with the wedding. However Tzeitel is in love with the poor tailor Motel Kamzoil and they ask permission to Tevye to get married that he accepts to please his daughter. Then his second daughter Hodel (Michele Marsh) and the revolutionary student Perchik decide to marry each other and Tevye is forced to accept. When Perchik is arrested by the Czar troops and sent to Siberia, Hodel decides to leave her family and homeland and travel to Siberia to be with her beloved Perchik....

Trivia
By the early 1970s Hollywood roadshow presentations--especially musicals--were now no longer popular with critics and audiences. Recent musicals, including Camelot (1967), Doctor Dolittle (1967), Star! (1968), Finian's Rainbow (1968), Sweet Charity (1969), Hello, Dolly! (1969), and On a Clear Day You Can See Forever (1970) were not as captivating, imaginative, realistic,, as the film adaptations of Broadway musicals prior, had been., those successful film adaptations, including West Side Story (1961), The Music Man (1962), Mary Poppins (1964), My Fair Lady (1964), The Sound of Music (1965), The Jungle Book (1967), Oliver! (1968), and Funny Girl (1968) were in the 1960s, so Norman Jewison , Walter Mirisch and United Artists were worried about how the film would do once it got released. When it was finally released in late 1971 it defied naysayers and received overwhelming critical acclaim and became the highest-grossing film of the year, besting films like Shaft (1971), Stanley Kubrick 's A Clockwork Orange (1971), Diamonds Are Forever (1971), Dirty Harry (1971) with Clint Eastwood , and the Academy Award-winning The French Connection (1971).

Subway trains are usually made up of a number of cars operated on the multiple-unit system. The Metro Center Station in the Washington, D.C., subway, opened 1976 Stuart Cohen/Comstock, Inc. Watch a subway tunnel being dug for the Munich underground rail system, 2009 film. Contunico © ZDF Enterprises GmbH, Mainz The first subway system was proposed for London by Charles Pearson, a city solicitor, as part of a city-improvement plan shortly after the opening of the Thames Tunnel in 1843. After 10 years of discussion, Parliament authorized the construction of 3.75 miles (6 km) of underground railway between Farringdon Street and Bishop’s Road, Paddington. Work on the Metropolitan Railway began in 1860 by cut-and-cover methods —that is, by making trenches along the streets, giving them brick sides, providing girders or a brick arch for the roof, and then restoring the roadway on top. On Jan. 10, 1863, the line was opened using steam locomotives that burned coke and, later, coal; despite sulfurous fumes, the line was a success from its opening, carrying 9,500,000 passengers in the first year of its existence. In 1866 the City of London and Southwark Subway Company (later the City and South London Railway) began work on their “tube” line, using a tunneling shield developed by J.H. Greathead. The tunnels were driven at a depth sufficient to avoid interference with building foundations or public-utility works, and there was no disruption of street traffic. The original plan called for cable operation, but electric traction was substituted before the line was opened. Operation began on this first electric underground railway in 1890 with a uniform fare of twopence for any journey on the 3-mile (5-kilometre) line. In 1900 Charles Tyson Yerkes , an American railway magnate, arrived in London, and he was subsequently responsible for the construction of more tube railways and for the electrification of the cut-and-cover lines. During World Wars I and II the tube stations performed the unplanned function of air-raid shelters. Similar Topics bus Many other cities followed London’s lead. In Budapest , a 2.5-mile (4-kilometre) electric subway was opened in 1896, using single cars with trolley poles; it was the first subway on the European continent. Considerable savings were achieved in its construction over earlier cut-and-cover methods by using a flat roof with steel beams instead of a brick arch, and therefore, a shallower trench. In Paris , the Métro (Chemin de Fer Métropolitain de Paris) was started in 1898, and the first 6.25 miles (10 km) were opened in 1900. The rapid progress was attributed to the wide streets overhead and the modification of the cut-and-cover method devised by the French engineer Fulgence Bienvenue. Vertical shafts were sunk at intervals along the route; and, from there, side trenches were dug and masonry foundations to support wooden shuttering were placed immediately under the road surfaces. Construction of the roof arch then proceeded with relatively little disturbance to street traffic. This method, while it is still used in Paris, has not been widely copied in subway construction elsewhere. In the United States the first practical subway line was constructed in Boston between 1895 and 1897. It was 1.5 miles (2.4 km) long and at first used trolley streetcars, or tramcars. Later, Boston acquired conventional subway trains. New York City opened the first section of what was to become the largest system in the world on Oct. 27, 1904. In Philadelphia, a subway system was opened in 1907, and Chicago’s system opened in 1943. Moscow constructed its original system in the 1930s.

tc_2116,Throughout the 80s and 90s Phil Collins recorded on which record label?,Atlantic,"This Week In History: FIRST Hits of the ‘70s, ‘80s & ‘90s « WCBS-FM 101.1
“Please Don’t Go”
KC and the Sunshine Band
The first No. 1 record of the 1980s was a comeback effort from the Hialeah, Florida-based ensemble, K.C. and the Sunshine Band with a BALLAD called “Please Don’t Go.” Wait—what? Yeah, it was a ballad from those disco/funk mavens of the ‘70s. But somehow, this record resonated with music lovers. Harry Wayne Casey (K.C.) formed what would become known as the Sunshine Band in 1975; initially with just his songwriting partner Richard Finch. I played their early recordings in the clubs at the Jersey Shore in late ’73 at the very, very start of what would become known as Disco music. Several musicians were added as the years went on for recording and live appearances. While on vacation in the spring of ’75, I remember sitting on the sands of Miami Beach and hearing a song called “Get Down Tonight” on the R&B stations of Miami. I turned to my then fiancé and said, “That will be a No. 1 Pop song by the summer. As you know, your Big Jay is rarely wrong, and indeed it was on top of the Hot 100 for a sole week in the summer of ’75. That was followed by “That’s The Way (I Like It)” at No. 1. A follow-up to that was a stinker on the Pop lists called “Queen Of Clubs.” But K.C. and Finch came up with another No. 1 smash “(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty” in ’76 on TK Records. Another stinker called “I Like To Do It” failed. Not to be deterred, “I’m Your Boogie Man” yielded yet another Pop chart-topper in ‘77, followed by “Keep It Comin’ Love” just missing the apex that year; stalling at No. 2. For some reason, after that hit, K.C. and the Sunshine Band couldn’t even reach the Top 30. However, “Boogie Shoes” a cut from the groups’ second album called K.C. and the Sunshine Band was resurrected from just being an album track to becoming a single and a key component to the film and soundtrack for Saturday Night Fever in 1978. And yet, after that was a charting 45 RPM, they still couldn’t duplicate its success. During the spring of ’79, K.C. and Finch wrote “Please Don’t Go” and included that on an album called Do You Wanna Go Party on TK Records. When released as a single in August of 1979, it seemed as if it wouldn’t catch on, being the first true ballad from the Disco mavens. But persistence paid off for not only TK Records and K.C. and the boys, becoming the very first No. 1 Pop hit of the 1980’s.
Not long after this record was recorded, K.C. (Harry Casey) decided to embark on a solo career. At first, while he was producing an album for an old high school friend Teri DeSario, her label’s head Neil Bogart (Casablanca Record) heard that K.C. was working on having her sing a remake of the 1965 smash for Barbara Lewis called “Yes I’m Ready.” Bogart wisely suggested it be done as a duet, with DeSario and Harry Casey. The only reason her version (with K.C.) didn’t reach No. 1 on the Hot 100, was because “Crazy Little Thing Called Love” stopped it at No. 2 for two weeks. After a serious motor-vehicle accident, where Harry was seriously injured, K.C. recovered after months of rehab, and, as a solo artist did manage to have one more “comeback” record in him called “Give It Up,” in the dance style that he was most known for; this time on the small Meca Records label after his label at the time Epic Records refused to release it. K.C. still tours with new musicians and has done a few concerts in conjunction with CBS-FM! He’s a great showman for sure. A postscript to the K.C. and the Sunshine Band story is that K.C.’s one-time writing and producing partner Richard Finch was arrested and convicted of sexual contact with male teens in (ahem) Licking County, Ohio. Finch is still incarcerated at an Ohio state penitentiary as of this writing.
First No. 1 Hit of the ‘90s

“Another Day In Paradise”
Phil Collins
Not bad for a guy who (as a young teen) was an extra in The Beatles ’ 1964 film A Hard Day’s Night and the guy who replaced Peter Gabriel in Genesis in 1975. The very first hit of the ‘90s decade was the very last No. 1 Hot 100 hit for Phil Collins with “Another Day In Paradise” on Atlantic Records. It was also the last No. 1 record of the ‘80s, as it had been a chart-topper for the last two weeks of that decade. But it was a strong No. 1 single, lasting four survey-phases in total as the prime hit in America. The tune was the first single from the Collins LP …But Seriously, released in September of ’89. That album was also was the first No. 1 LP in the U.S. in the ‘90s. The song “Another Day In Paradise” was yet another foray into the plight of homelessness that Collins had already tackled on a song he recorded with Genesis (with Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford) called “Man On The Corner” which only reached No. 40 on the Hot 100 back in 1981 from an otherwise fairly successful LP called Abacab. That album also featured the hits “No Reply At All” (No. 29 Pop in ‘81) and “Abacab” (No. 26 Pop, peaking in ‘82) on Atlantic Records. Back to “Another Day In Paradise”—the song featured singing legend David Crosby on backing vocals along with Dominic Miller on guitar, and Leland Sklar on bass.
“Another Day In Paradise” was Phil Collins’ seventh and final No. 1 single to date. The LP version of the song from …But Seriously, clocked in at over five minutes long; but was edited down to a more radio-friendly 4:04 for single release. “Another Day In Paradise” was eventually named Grammy® Record of the Year for 1990. It had also been nominated for Song of the Year, ultimately won by “From A Distance for songwriter Julie Gold, performed by Bette Midler, Best Music Video, Short Form, in the end won by the Paula Abdul song’s “Opposites Attract” video) and Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male, made victorious by the then recently deceased Roy Orbison for a remake of “Oh, Pretty Woman.” But it was the producer’s award that got Collins and co-producer Hugh Padgham their big winner at that ceremony in early ’91. Phil Collins and David Crosby performed the composition live on the night of the Grammy Awards® Show televised on NBC from Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan. Over in merry-old England, “Another Day In Paradise” won the BRIT Award® for Best British Single. His six other No. 1 songs include: “Against All Odds (Take A Look At Me Now)” from ’84, “One More Night” from ’85, “Sussudio” from the same year, and “Separate Lives” also from ’85—a duet with Marilyn Martin, “Groovy Kind Of Love” a re-make of the Mindbenders ’66 hit (co-written by a young Carole Bayer Sager and Toni Wine—the female singer on “Sugar, Sugar” by the Archies, and “Two Hearts,” No. 1 in early 1989 co-written by the great Motown and beyond legend, Lamont Dozier, Earth, Wind & Fire’s lead singer Phillip Bailey’s collaboration with Collins on “Easy Lover” reached No. 2 on the Hot 100 for two weeks in early ’85 prevented from the No. 1 spot by Foreigner’s “I Want To Know What Love Is.” And, though it wasn’t a gigantic hit (No. 21 Pop) the last entry from Phil Collins in the 1990s (1999 to be exact) won him an Oscar® for Best Song for “You’ll Be In My Heart” from the motion-picture Tarzan. Phillip David Charles Collins was inducted into the class of 2010 of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis.
Collins announced the next year that he was retiring from the recording and live concert business due to health issues including arm troubles due to playing the drums for so many years and some personal issues. But during the spring of 2015, Collins announced he was coming out of retirement. He planned to re-release re-mastered versions of his eight solo LPs, and would write a new album and return to the concert stage. In addition, Phil plans to have an autobiography released sometime in 2016.

Around fifty years ago, the United States of America and Russia were competing with each other to prove that they were the most powerful country in the world. Space exploration became a key area in which they could show their superiority. Russia beat the United States to put the first man in space, when in 1961 Yuri Gagarin flew into space in his rocket, Vostok 1. Newly elected US President John F Kennedy decided to show America's might by challenging NASA to put a man on the moon , in less than ten years. Click to hear an excerpt of the speech John F Kennedy made at Rice University in 1962, outlining his plans for a manned American mission to the moon. The first men to walk on the moon On 20th July 1969, NASA met President Kennedy's challenge, and Neil Armstrong (left) and Buzz Aldrin (right) became the first and second men to walk on the moon. Listen to a sound clip of the landing by clicking here . Michael Collins (centre) waited for them in orbit around the moon, in the command module spacecraft that would take them all home. When they landed, the first words said on the moon were ""the Eagle has landed"", and as Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon's surface he said ""that's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. Listen to this famous speech by clicking here . They explored the moon's surface for less than three hours, collecting 22 kilograms of rocks for study back on earth. When they returned to earth they were welcomed as celebrities, and international heroes! The first Apollo crew died tragically in an accident during training. NASA then made changes to make Apollo spacecraft safer for their crews. Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft that flew the 250,000 miles to the moon. They flew round the moon and came back again, but did not land. Apollo 11 was the mission where NASA were satisfied every part of the spacecraft had been tested and was ready for an attempt to land on the moon. The last Apollo mission was Apollo 17. By 1972 public interest was waning in moon landings, and since Apollo 17, no-one has returned to the moon. The early Apollo missions Following President Kennedy's challenge in 1961, NASA began a race to land people on the moon before the end of the 1960's. After the Apollo 1 tragedy, when a fire inside the command module killed three astronauts, NASA revisited the design of the Apollo spacecraft, making many changes to improve safety. When Apollo missions restarted, they were unmanned - Apollo flights 2 to 6 were remote controlled flights, used by NASA to test each of the parts of the Apollo spacecraft, making sure everything worked before any astronauts were carried into space. Apollo 7 was the first manned flight, and Apollo 8 proved that astronauts could fly all the way to the moon and back, though the crew did not land. Apollo 9 and 10 were used for testing the Lunar Module, the spacecraft that would land on the moon. That meant that by Apollo 11, everything was ready to attempt a moon landing! Landing on the moon Using the knowledge gained from the previous Apollo missions, NASA decided the Apollo 11 crew would try for a moon landing. Three days after launching from earth, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin flew the Lunar Module down to the moon's surface. The world listened as the astronauts struggled to find a suitable site to land their spacecraft. When they touched down, their instruments reported that they had only about 20 seconds worth of fuel left!

Donald Kennon, Ph.D.,    Vice President for Scholarship and Education, U.S. Capitol Historical Society
Foreign Press Center
Washington, DC
January 14, 2009
Moderator: Ladies and gentlemen, it’s my pleasure to introduce to everybody today Dr. Donald Kennon. He is the Chief Historian of the U.S. Capitol Historical Society. He’s also the Vice President of Fellowship and Education for the Society.
Dr. Kennon received his PhD in American History from the Univesrity of Maryland and has been involved in several publications dealing with the history of the United States.
Some of his publications include Speaker of the House of Representatives, a bibliography; and the Committee on Ways and Means -- a Bicentennial History.
I’ll turn the time over to Dr. Kennon.
Donald Kennon: Thank you, Matt, for that introduction. Four years ago I did a similar briefing here for the Foreign Press Center. Some of you may have been here at that time. I have changed my remarks somewhat. At that time I gave pretty much a prepared speech and tried to be deep and philosophical about the meaning of America’s presidential inaugurations. Today what I want to do is give you a little bit of that, but mostly to talk about some of the interesting precedents in American history involving presidential inaugurations and how it has evolved to what you will see on January 20th, next Tuesday. Then I’ll be very happy to take any questions you might have.
I must say that in preparing for this I reviewed the current state of press coverage of the history of presidential inaugurations by the American press and I was very very impressed. There’s some very high quality reporting being done by the news in the United States about historical precedents involved with our presidential inauguration. At least the American press is doing a good job and I’m sure you will too. You can find a lot of good information in American coverage and especially on the internet and various sources.
Let me begin by on Tuesday, January 20, 2009 the Presidential Oath of Office will be administered for the 70th time in American history. This year’s presidential inauguration is the 56th quadrennial inaugural ceremony since George Washington was inaugurated as the first president in 1789 in New York City. The 2009 ceremony will be the 51st such ceremony at the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., and the 7th on the Capitol’s West Front. But even more historically, it will be the first time which the oath is taken by an African-American.
Shortly after noon, at noon or shortly thereafter, Barack Obama will take the Oath of Office as the 44th President in American history. The 20th Amendment to the Constitution ratified in 1933 provides that the term of the President begins at noon on January 20th. However, before executing the powers of his office the President must take the Oath of Office as specified in Article 2, Section 1 of the Constitution. That 35 word oath is, “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”
It’s probably safe to say that the presidential inauguration is the transcendent ritual of America’s democracy and representative government. Unlike the coronation of a monarch or any ritual associated with the rise to power of a dictator or autocrat, the inauguration of the American President is a cyclical, regularly scheduled event held every four years. The regularity of presidential inaugurations lends a sense of reassuring stability, continuity and permanence to a political system that permits turnover in office holders and change in policy agendas. Moreover it is a peaceful change in government, unlike the violence that so often has accompanied a change in head of state elsewhere.
Consider some of the symbolism of inauguration day. In instances in which a new President has been elected, the President-elect is greeted at the White House by the outgoing President who escorts him to the Capitol. They ride together.

Was Dr Crippen innocent of his wife's murder? - BBC News BBC News Was Dr Crippen innocent of his wife's murder? 29 July 2010 Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Hawley Crippen, the doctor hanged for the gruesome murder of his wife Cora, is one of the most infamous killers in British history. Exactly 100 years after his arrest, why is there a campaign to prove his innocence, asks Stephen Tomkins? Having the surname Crippen does not endear you to UK Customs, according to a distant relative of the infamous doctor convicted of killing his wife. James Patrick Crippen of Ohio, second cousin three times removed of Dr Hawley Crippen, hopes to officially exonerate the black sheep of the family and bring his remains to the family plot in Michigan for a decent burial. ""The evidence says the man should be pardoned,"" he says. ""But everyone thinks of him as a murderer. Every time I have come through customs to England, someone has made a comment on my name, linking me to a murderer."" Crippen rose to infamy by allegedly poisoning and dismembering his wife, hiding her remains under the basement floor, and fleeing for North America with his lover - and then being the first person to be caught using the wireless telegraph. The message was sent 100 years ago, and Crippen was arrested on arrival in Quebec on 31 July, 1910. His trial lasted only five days, and the jury's deliberations for less than half an hour. The role of wireless radio Captain Henry Kendall saw through Crippen's disguise as the doctor boarded his ship with his lover dressed as a boy The SS Montrose was one of very few Canadian Pacific liners fitted with a Marconi wireless radio Kendall had the operator wire the White Star Line Offices in London The message read: ""Have strong suspicions that Crippen - London cellar murderer and accomplice are among Saloon passengers. Moustache taken off - growing beard. Accomplice dressed as boy. Voice manner and build undoubtedly a girl."" British police caught a faster ship to Quebec and were there for Crippen's arrival The torso was identified as Cora Crippen's by a scar, the doctor was shown to have bought a large amount of the drug that killed her, and on his arrest he told Chief Inspector Dew: ""I am not sorry; the anxiety has been too much."" The mild-mannered murderer became a national celebrity and his waxwork stands in Madame Tussauds to this day. But was it all a huge miscarriage of justice? Was Crippen innocent after all? A growing body of people believe so, including family members and forensic scientists, and a campaign is under way to clear his name. One line of evidence comes from John Trestrail, a toxicologist who has long puzzled over the mutilation of the corpse. The remains found were a torso without bones or sex organs. Mutilation is extremely unusual behaviour among poisoners, Mr Trestrail says. ""A poisoner wants the death to appear natural so he can get a death certificate. This is the only case I know of where the victim was dismembered. It doesn't make sense."" 'He finally cracked' Mr Trestrail brought in Professor David Foran, director of forensic science at Michigan State University, who led DNA analysis on the scarred skin of the corpse used in the trial. It was demanding work over two years, retrieving tissue preserved in formaldehyde from the glass slide it was attached to with pine resin. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Crippen's house in north London has since been demolished Mr Foran followed two lines of research and considers the results conclusive. First he isolated mitochondrial DNA, which remains unchanged throughout the generations down the female line. A genealogist found grandnieces of Cora Crippen who would have the same mitochondrial DNA as her, and repeated tests found they were not related to the body in the basement. Then Mr Foran's team used new techniques to examine the nuclear DNA, and discovered a Y chromosome. Not only was the body not from Cora Crippen's family, it wasn't even a woman. As Mr Trestrail sums it up, ""This is the slide which Spilsbury [the expert witness at the trial] used to identify the body as Cora Crippen's. And this was the evidence on which Crippen was convicted. But the substance in the slide is not Cora Crippen. No question. I don't say Hawley Crippen is innocent, but he is no longer proven guilty."" Not everyone is convinced, however. John Boyne, whose book Crippen: A Novel of Murder, is to be reissued next year, says: ""I think Crippen probably did kill his wife. His actions suggest guilt - his decision to flee the country and to dress Ethel LeNeve as his son rather than allow her to reveal her true identity on the ship as his lover. Cora made his life so miserable that I think he finally cracked."" I have no interest in clearing Crippen's name. What I care about is being right Professor David Foran, Forensic scientist Jonathan Menges, a writer and genealogist from San Diego, has written disputing Mr Foran's findings. Mr Menges claims the genealogy linking the living relatives to Cora Crippen is flawed - no birth certificate for her exists, for example, as they were rare in the US at the time - making the mitochondrial DNA tests irrelevant. He criticises the proceedings for having too much of an eye for showbiz - the nuclear DNA findings were first revealed on a TV documentary - and points out that they have not yet been published or peer-reviewed. He says that Crippen's behaviour demonstrates his guilt, and that a group in Salt Lake City are investigating the mysterious disappearance there of Crippen's first wife. ""There is no doubt that Crippen is guilty,"" he says. Mr Foran responds that his work is to be published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, that he is fully satisfied by the genealogy, and that the remains are indisputably male. ""I don't really care one way or the other whether the body was Cora Crippen's, I have no interest in clearing Crippen's name. What I care about is being right. We tested and tested and tested, and if I had any doubts whatsoever I would never have come out with it. The body is not Cora Crippen's."" Nevertheless, JP Crippen has failed to get the case reopened. The Criminal Cases Review Commission declined to refer it to the Court of Appeal, because he is too distant a relative to have sufficient interest. But Mr Trestrail agrees with him that the campaign to clear his name should continue. ""It matters,"" he says. ""Justice doesn't have a time limit.""","The context explicitly states that Dr. Crippen was convicted of murdering his wife, Cora Henrietta Crippen. The remains found in his cellar were identified as her body, and he was found guilty after a trial. Despite some controversies and DNA evidence suggesting the remains may not be hers, the context confirms that he was convicted of murdering his wife.",49,1,1,1,1,1

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests. Wind Cave National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument, and Custer State Park are attractions. The 6,000 ft (1,829 m) Mt. Rushmore, with its gigantic open-air sculpture of Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and T. Roosevelt, is famous throughout the world (see Mount Rushmore National Memorial ).

Our government at work — This is the daily “Profile America” feature from the U.S. Census Bureau for today, Friday, October 8th. This is the 81st anniversary of the first in-flight movie ever shown. A little-known travel gem.
Friday, October 8th, celebrates one of the few joys left in long-distance flying, sitting back and enjoying a feature-length movie. But recently, one major airline announced it will be ending this entertainment, joining several low-cost airlines in the policy. While movies have been generally available on long flights for decades, the first movies shown in the air were a newsreel and two cartoons. These were shown on this date in 1929 aboard a Ford Trimotor operated by Transcontinental Air Transport. Regular in-flight movie service began in July 1961 on a Trans World airline flight from New York to Los Angeles. Now, more than 3.9 million passengers fly between New York and Los Angeles every year. You can find these and more facts about America from the U.S. Census Bureau online at

Different types of Coal – Coal Types WA | Griffin Coal Coal Types Vast specifications from locations all over the world. There are several different types of coal, that have different properties usually dependent on their age and the depth to which they have been buried under other rocks. In some parts of the world (for example New Zealand), coal development is accelerated by volcanic heat or crustal stresses. The degree of coal development is referred to as a coal’s “rank,” with peat being the lowest rank coal and anthracite the highest. Peat Peat is the layer of vegetable material directly underlying the growing zone of a coal forming environment. The vegetable material shows very little alteration and contains the roots of living plants. Peat is widely used as a domestic fuel in rural parts of Scotland and Ireland. Lignite Lignite is geologically very young (upwards of around 40,000 years). It is brown and can be soft and fibrous, containing discernible plant material. It also contains large amounts of moisture (around 70%) and so has a low energy content: around 8 to 10 megajoules per kilogram. This coal is mined extensively in the Latrobe Valley south east of Melbourne, Australia. As the coal develops it loses its fibrous character and darkens in colour.","The context explicitly states that lignite is brown and can be soft and fibrous, and it describes fibrous lignite as having a structure similar to peat.

Truffles are in the genus Tuber, order Pezizales (phylum Ascomycota , kingdom Fungi). They are native mainly to temperate regions. The different species range in size from that of a pea to that of an orange. Discover the chemistry of truffles, the most expensive food in the world. © American Chemical Society (A Britannica Publishing Partner) Black truffles. Poppy A section of a young specimen shows a whitish homogeneous flesh that with age becomes a rich dark colour showing a lighter marbling. Truffles flourish in open woodland on calcareous soil. They are saprophytes, usually associated with the roots of trees, possibly in a mutually beneficial association (see mycorrhiza ). The spores of Tuber are large; one to four may be seen in a spore sac, or ascus. (These, the first ascospores to be observed, were described by French botanist Joseph Pitton de Tournefort in 1701–11.) The most-valued truffle in French cuisine is the Périgord (Tuber melanosporum), which is said to have first gained favour toward the end of the 15th century. It is brown or black, rounded, and covered with polygonal wartlike protrusions, having a depression at their summit; the flesh (gleba) is first white, then brown or gray, and when mature becomes black with white veins having a brown margin. The odour is well marked and pleasant. The main French truffières (truffle grounds) are in the south, notably in Périgord and the région of Provence–Alpes–Côte d’Azur , though truffles are gathered throughout a large part of France. The truffle industry is an important one in France, and about one-third of the gatherings are exported. The French government undertook the reforesting of many large and barren areas, for many of the best truffle regions become productive by the planting of trees, particularly oaks. Because truffles often occur at depths down to about 30 centimetres (12 inches), it is difficult to detect them unaided. Truffles, when occurring near the surface of the ground, crack it as they reach full size, and experienced gatherers can detect them. Furthermore, in the morning and evening, columns of small yellow flies may be seen hovering over a colony. Occasionally an individual is sufficiently sensitive to the scent of truffles to locate them, but truffle hunting is usually carried on with the aid of trained dogs or female pigs (which are attracted by the truffle’s scent, similar to that of male pig pheromones). Britannica Stories Ringling Bros. Folds Its Tent Although truffles are much desired as food, direct cultivation of truffles for commerce is difficult. Calcareous ground is dug over and acorns or seedlings planted. Soil from truffle areas is usually spread about, and the ground is kept in condition by light plowing and harrowing. After three years, clearings are made and the trees pruned. If they are to appear, truffles do so only after about five years; gathering begins then but is not very profitable until 8 or 10 years have passed. The yield is at its maximum from 5 to 25 years later. The English truffle, T. aestivum, is found principally in beech woods. It is bluish black, rounded, and covered with coarse polygonal warts; the gleba is white when immature, then yellowish, and finally brown with white branched markings. Truffles are relatively rare in North America , being found most often in temperate forests of the Pacific Northwest . In addition to the “true truffles,” there are a number of “false truffles,” which are classified as club fungi ( Basidiomycota ). The Basidiomycota include puffballs, mushrooms, shelf fungi, and plant rusts and smuts. Similar to the Ascomycota in many ways, they differ in bearing their spores on the outside rather than inside.","The context explicitly states that truffles are a type of fungus, belonging to the kingdom Fungi, and are part of the Ascomycota phylum.

What is the fastest animal on two legs?
A:
Quick Answer
The ostrich runs faster than any other two-legged animal. Its has a top speed of 40 mph, and it can run at 30 mph for up to 30 minutes.
Full Answer
Ostriches are able to achieve high speeds and levels of endurance due to their massive thigh muscles, long legs, stable joints and unique toe structure. The thigh muscles and long legs allow ostriches to take up to 16-foot strides when running. Their joints prevent sideways movement, freeing up muscle energy that could otherwise be wasted maintaining stability. The ostrich's soft, taloned, two-toed feet aid in balance, shock absorption and traction, while its tip-toe running posture gives the ostrich a spring-like launch with every step.

The fastest creature on two legs
by Tswalu Kalahari on Sun, November 18, 2012 in News, Wildlife, 
Not many animals choose to move around on two legs. The life of a four-legged animal is much easier on the spine and on the skeleton as a whole.
Most birds have better things to do with their forelimbs, such as flying! The ostrich, however, has never been granted the gift of flight. Despite this, the ostrich has maintained the two-legged lifestyle of its feathered cousins.
If you cannot fly you had better be fast! And fast they are, clocking speeds of up to 70km per hour, making them the fastest bipedal (two-legged) animal on earth.
When you are travelling at such high speeds it is important to be able to see where you are going and the ostrich is well equipped in this department. Their eyes are the largest of any land animal, and, at 5 centimetres in diameter, they are bigger than their brains!
The Kalahari is a harsh environment for ostriches, however, as far as predators are concerned. Lions, leopards, cheetahs and hyaenas all stalk the night. The ostrich is never perfectly at rest, having always to keep an eye out for any of the predators that would happily make a meal out of them.

The title clearly says “What Is the Fastest Animal on Earth?” not “What Is the Fastest Animal in the air?” therefore cheetah is the correct answer
iamlumin
From Cheetah Conservation Fund website: The cheetah is aerodynamically built for speed and can accelerate from zero to 40 mph in three strides and to full speed of 70 mph in seconds. As the cheetah runs, only one foot at a time touches the ground. There are two points, in its 20 to 25 foot (7-8 metres) stride when no feet touch the ground, as they are fully extended and then totally doubled up. Nearing full speed, the cheetah is running at about 3 strides per second.

Significance of Animal Behavior Research
Significance of Animal Behavior Research
Prepared by Charles T. Snowdon
[while President of the Animal Behavior Society]
Animal behavior is the bridge between the molecular and physiological aspects of biology and the ecological. Behavior is the link between organisms and environment and between the nervous system, and the ecosystem. Behavior is one of the most important properties of animal life. Behavior plays a critical role in biological adaptations. Behavior is how we humans define our own lives. Behavior is that part of an organism by which it interacts with its environment. Behavior is as much a part of an organisms as its coat, wings etc. The beauty of an animal includes its behavioral attributes.
For the same reasons that we study the universe and subatomic particles there is intrinsic interest in the study of animals. In view of the amount of time that television devotes to animal films and the amount of money that people spend on nature books there is much more public interest in animal behavior than in neutrons and neurons. If human curiosity drives research, then animal behavior should be near the top of our priorities.
Research on animal behavior and behavioral ecology has been burgeoning in recent years despite below inflation increases (and often decreases) in research funding. Two of our journals Animal Behaviour and Behavior Ecology and Sociobiology rank in the top six behavioral science AND zoological journals in terms of impact as measured by the Science Citation Index. From 1985 to 1990 Animal Behaviour has grown from quarterly to monthly publication and its page budget has more than doubled. Many related journals have increased their size and frequency of publication in the same period. Ours is an active and vital field.
While the study of animal behavior is important as a scientific field on its own, our science has made important contributions to other disciplines with applications to the study of human behavior, to the neurosciences, to the environment and resource management, to the study of animal welfare and to the education of future generations of scientists.
A.  ANIMAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN SOCIETY
Many problems in human society are often related to the interaction of environment and behavior or genetics and behavior. The fields of socioecology and animal behavior deal with the issue of environment behavioral interactions both at an evolutionary level and a proximate level. Increasingly social scientists are turning to animal behavior as a framework in which to interpret human society and to understand possible causes of societal problems. (e.g. Daly and Wilson's book on human homicide is based on an evolutionary analysis from animal research. Many studies on child abuse utilize theory and data from studies on infanticide in animals.)
Research by de Waal on chimpanzees and monkeys has illustrated the importance of cooperation and reconciliation in social groups. This work provides new perspectives by which to view and ameliorate aggressive behavior among human beings.
The methodology applied to study animal behavior has had a tremendous impact in psychology and the social sciences. Jean Piaget began his career with the study of snails, and he extended the use of careful behavioral observations and descriptions to his landmark studies on human cognitive development. J. B. Watson began his study of behavior by observing gulls. Aspects of experimental design, observation techniques, attention to nonverbal communication signals were often developed in animal behavior studies before their application to studies of human behavior. The behavioral study of humans would be much diminished today without the influence of animal research.
Charles Darwin's work on emotional expression in animals has had an important influence on many psychologists, such as Paul Ekman, who study human emotional behavior.

Plant Kingdom
Plant Kingdom
(or Plantae )
Virtually all other living creatures depend on plants to survive.     Through photosynthesis , plants     convert energy from sunlight into food stored as carbohydrates. Because     animals cannot get energy directly from the sun, they must eat plants (or     other animals that have had a vegetarian meal) to survive. Plants also     provide the oxygen humans and animals breathe, because plants use carbon     dioxide for photosynthesis and release oxygen into the atmosphere.
Plants are found on land, in oceans, and in fresh water. They have been     on Earth for millions of years. Plants were on Earth before animals and     currently number about 260,000 species. Three features distinguish plants     from animals:
Plants have chlorophyll , a green       pigment necessary for photosynthesis;
Their cell walls are made sturdy by a material called cellulose ; and
They are fixed in one place (they don’t move).
Plant Classification
In order to study the billions of different organisms living on earth,     biologists have sorted and classified them based on their similarities and     differences. This system of classification is also     called a taxonomy and usually     features both English and Latin names for the different divisions.
All plants are included in one so-called kingdom (Kingdom Plantae), which is then broken down into smaller and smaller     divisions based on several characteristics, including:
Whether they can circulate fluids (like rainwater) through their       bodies or need to absorb them from the moisture that surrounds       them;
How they reproduce (e.g., by spores or different kinds       of seeds); and
Their size or stature.
The majority of the 260,000 plant species are flowering herbs. To     describe all plant species, the following divisions (or phyla) are most     commonly used to sort them. The first grouping is made up of plants that     are non-vascular; they cannot circulate rainwater through their stems and     leaves but must absorb it from the environment that surrounds them. The     remaining plant species are all vascular (they have a     system for circulating fluids). This larger group is then split into two     groups: one that reproduces from spores rather than seeds, and the other     that reproduces from seeds.
Non-Vascular Plants
Mosses and “allies,” or related species (Bryophyta and     allies)
Mosses or bryophyta are non-vascular. They are an important     foundation plant for the forest ecosystem and they help prevent erosion by     carpeting the forest floor. All bryophyte species reproduce by spores not     seeds, never have flowers, and are found growing on the ground, on rocks,     and on other plants.
Originally grouped as a single division or phylum, the 24,000     bryophyte species are now grouped in three divisions: Mosses (Bryophyta), Liverworts (Hepatophyta), and Hornworts (Anthocerotophyta). Also included among the non-vascular plants     is Chlorophyta , a kind of fresh-water algae.
Vascular Plants with Spores
Ferns and allies (Pteridophyta and allies)
Unlike mosses, ferns and related species have a vascular system, but     like mosses, they reproduce from spores rather than seeds. The ferns are     the most plentiful plant division in this group, with 12,000 species.     Other divisions (the fern allies) include Club mosses or Lycopods     (Lycopodiophyta) with 1,000 species, Horsetails (Equisetophyta)     with 40 species, and Whisk ferns (Psilophyta) with 3 species.

Insulin Regulation of Blood Sugar and Diabetes - The Important Roles of Insulin and Glucagon: Diabetes and Hypoglycemia
Normal Regulation of Blood Glucose
The Important Roles of Insulin and Glucagon: Diabetes and Hypoglycemia
Written by James  Norman MD, FACS, FACE
The human body wants blood glucose (blood sugar) maintained in a very narrow range. Insulin and glucagon are the hormones which make this happen. Both insulin and glucagon are secreted from the pancreas, and thus are referred to as pancreatic endocrine hormones. The picture on the left shows the intimate relationship both insulin and glucagon have to each other. Note that the pancreas serves as the central player in this scheme.  It is the production of insulin and glucagon by the pancreas which ultimately determines if a patient has diabetes, hypoglycemia, or some other sugar problem.
In this Article
Insulin's Role in Blood Glucose Control
Insulin Basics: How Insulin Helps Control Blood Glucose Levels
Insulin and glucagon are hormones secreted by islet cells within the pancreas. They are both secreted in response to blood sugar levels, but in opposite fashion!
Insulin is normally secreted by the beta cells (a type of islet cell) of the pancreas. The stimulus for insulin secretion is a HIGH blood glucose...it's as simple as that!  Although there is always a low level of insulin secreted by the pancreas, the amount secreted into the blood increases as the blood glucose rises. Similarly, as blood glucose falls, the amount of insulin secreted by the pancreatic islets goes down. 
As can be seen in the picture, insulin has an effect on a number of cells, including muscle, red blood cells, and fat cells.  In response to insulin, these cells absorb glucose out of the blood, having the net effect of lowering the high blood glucose levels into the normal range.
Glucagon is secreted by the alpha cells of the pancreatic islets in much the same manner as insulin...except in the opposite direction. If blood glucose is high, then no glucagon is secreted. 
When blood glucose goes LOW, however, (such as between meals, and during exercise) more and more glucagon is secreted. Like insulin, glucagon has an effect on many cells of the body, but most notably the liver.
The Role of Glucagon in Blood Glucose Control
The effect of glucagon is to make the liver release the glucose it has stored in its cells into the bloodstream, with the net effect of increasing blood glucose. Glucagon also induces the liver (and some other cells such as muscle) to make glucose out of building blocks obtained from other nutrients found in the body (eg, protein).
Our bodies desire blood glucose to be maintained between 70 mg/dl and 110 mg/dl (mg/dl means milligrams of glucose in 100 milliliters of blood). Below 70 is termed ""hypoglycemia."" Above 110 can be normal if you have eaten within 2 to 3 hours.  That is why your doctor wants to measure your blood glucose while you are fasting...it should be between 70 and 110.  Even after you have eaten, however, your glucose should be below 180. Above 180 is termed ""hyperglycemia"" (which translates to mean ""too much glucose in the blood""). If your 2 two blood sugar measurements above 200 after drinking a sugar-water drink (glucose tolerance test), then you are diagnosed with diabetes.  
Updated on: 03/02/16","The context explains that the pancreas produces hormones such as insulin and glucagon to regulate blood sugar levels. Insulin is specifically secreted by the pancreas to lower blood glucose levels, as it helps cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream. This is directly supported by the context, which describes insulin's role in controlling blood sugar by facilitating glucose uptake by cells.",62,1,1,1,1,1

Muscles of the Leg and Foot
Supporting, balancing, and propelling the body is the work of the muscular system of the legs and feet. From the large, strong muscles of the buttocks and legs to the tiny, fine muscles of the feet and toes, these muscles can exert tremendous power while constantly making small adjustments for balance – whether the body is at rest or in motion.
The powerful muscles of the hip, buttock, and pelvis actuate the flexible ball-and-socket hip joint....

Full Muscles of the Leg and Foot Description
[Continued from above] . . . The anterior muscles, such as the quadriceps femoris, iliopsoas, and sartorius, work as a group to flex the thigh at the hip and extend the leg at the knee. Posterior muscles, such as the hamstrings and gluteus maximus, produce the opposite motion – extension of the thigh at the hip and flexion of the leg at the knee. Lateral muscles, such as the gluteus medius, abduct the thigh at the hip while the medial groin muscles adduct the thigh. All of these muscle groups provide powerful contractions to propel the body while making fine adjustments to maintain the body’s posture and balance.
Located inferior to the knee are a number of muscles that move the ankle, foot, and toes. The calf muscles, including the gastrocnemius and soleus, join to form the strong calcaneal (Achilles) tendon of the heel and attach to the calcaneus bone in the heel. These muscles contract to plantar flex the foot – such as when standing on your tiptoes – and flex the toes. Shin muscles, such as the tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus, dorsiflex the foot and extend the toes. The muscles of the calf also work subtly to stabilize the ankle joint and foot and to maintain the body’s balance.

How Your Leg Muscles Work
If you're lounging as you read this, the next sentence may scare you sit-less.
""Sitting is the new smoking; it's just as insidious,"" says Marc Hamilton, PhD, a physiology professor at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Hamilton is making a point about how so many Americans are letting their leg muscles — and therefore their bodies — turn to mush. ""You've seen the flat line on an EKG, when all the doctors rush in? That's what's happening to your leg muscles when you're sitting.""
As he speaks, I flash back to a job I had at a digital agency. I showed up on my first day of work in the New York City office to find half the staff standing at their computers. Because they didn't have chairs. The office consisted mostly of jerry-rigged desks about waist-high that we would belly up to like a bar.
Turns out my hipster coworkers were onto something. ""Standing while talking on the phone or filing isn't exercise by anybody's standard,"" Hamilton says, ""yet, compared with sitting, it increases your metabolic rate a bit."" According to a widely accepted compendium of physical activity, doing ""light office work"" while sitting burns 96 calories an hour for an average 140-pound woman as opposed to 147 calories while standing. Besides, Hamilton adds, ""when we're sitting for extended periods, hundreds of 'bad' genes are turned on, including ones that stimulate muscle atrophy.""

The ovaries are magnificent glands which are part of the female reproductive system. The ovaries are about the size and shape of an almond and sit just above the fallopian tubes -- one ovary on each side of the uterus. Every month during ovulation, either the right or left ovary produces a single mature egg for fertilization.
Did you know that when a baby girl is born, she already has about 1,000,000 ovarian follicles?
Each ovarian follicle contains a hollow ball of cells with an immature egg in the center. During childhood, approximately half of ovarian follicles are absorbed by the body. By the time a girl reaches puberty and her menstrual cycle begins, only about 400,000 ovarian follicles are left to develop into mature eggs.
Although only one egg usually fully matures during ovulation, somewhere between ten and 20 follicles begin the process of maturation monthly. The excess ovarian follicles are reabsorbed before ovulation occurs.
The process of ovulation is started and controlled by a drop in the hormone estrogen (mostly estradiol secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) thus sending a message to the pituitary gland to increase its secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). The increase in FSH causes the growth of ten to 20 of the ovarian follicles.
Estrogen is secreted by some of the cells in the follicle.
Just before ovulation occurs, the follicle that contains the maturing egg eases toward the surface of the ovary. Once the matured egg reaches the ovarian surface, ovulation occurs when the follicle and the ovarian surface open allowing the egg to drift out of the ovary.
Additionally, progesterone is also produced by the cells in the ovarian follicles shortly before ovulation occurs.
After ovulation, if pregnancy has not occurred, the empty follicle is called the corpus luteum and it is reabsorbed into the body. If pregnancy does occur the corpus luteum produces hormones that help to maintain the pregnancy.
After the egg is released from the ovary it travels to the oviducts (the funnel-shaped ends of the fallopian tubes) where it begins its long journey of several days into the uterus. The mature egg is moved along on its journey through the fallopian tubes by wavelike muscle contractions in the fallopian tube. The inner lining of each fallopian tube contains cilia which are constantly beating microscopic hairs; these cilia are what helps move the sperm towards the egg if a woman has had unprotected sexual intercourse. Conception (the fertilization of an egg with sperm) most often occurs in the part of the tubes that is nearest the ovary. Five to six days are required for the fertilized egg to reach the uterus.
Midcycle Pain or Discomfort
Some women experience a twinge, a cramp, or some discomfort in the lower back or abdomen when ovulation occurs.
Women sometimes notice a small amount of vaginal discharge, sometimes containing a small amount of blood, during ovulation. For some women these symptoms are severe enough to be mistaken for an  ectopic pregnancy  or appendicitis. Other women experience headaches, gastric pain, or a general  malaise ; while others women experience feeling much better during ovulation. When women experience these symptoms during ovulation it is called Mittelschmerz or midcyle pain.
Ovarian Cysts
Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs, similar to blisters. Ovarian cysts are common among women during their reproductive years and are growths that form on either of the two almond-sized glands on each side of the uterus. Most types of ovarian cysts are harmless and go away without any treatment.

Hormones and Your Menstrual Cycle
By Dawn Stacey, PhD, LMHC - Reviewed by a board-certified physician.
Updated June 15, 2016
Question: How Do Hormones Control Your Menstrual Cycle?
Your menstrual cycle is controlled by hormone signals in the brain. Each month, your ovary will release an egg (known as ovulation ) after the egg has matured. The egg enters into the fallopian tube and makes its way down to the uterus with hopes that a sperm will fertilize it. Your monthly menstrual cycle begins on the first day of your period and lasts until the first day of your next period.
There are Two Parts of Your Menstrual Cycle:
The first part of your menstrual cycle is called the follicular phase. This phase starts on the first day of your last period and continues until the day you ovulate. This phase of your menstrual cycle may be different for every woman (lasting anywhere from 7 days until 40 days). The second part of your menstrual cycle is called the luteal phase. This phase begins on the day of ovulation and lasts until your next period starts. The luteal phase usually has a more precise timeline -- for most women, this part of your menstrual cycle typically lasts around 12-16 days. 
Breaking Down Your Menstrual Cycle:
Now that you understand the two phases of your menstrual cycle, let’s take a look at what is normally going on inside your body each month. This is where you can see how your hormones are controlling what is happening.
Hormones and the Follicular Phase:
The Starting Place:
Everything begins with when the hypothalamus (a structure in your brain) produces the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).
Once produced, the GnRH will then trigger your pituitary gland to release the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). This hormone's job is to stimulate the growth and development of your eggs.
The Follicle Stimulating Hormone:
The FSH then makes the journey through your bloodstream to your ovaries.
Once the follicle stimulating hormone arrives, it triggers the growth of a follicle (a small sac that contains an egg) to develop into a mature egg.
The Role of the Follicle:
As the follicle develops and matures, it produces the hormone, estrogen .
After about 10 days, the estrogen levels reach high numbers.
The estrogen level peaks approximately one day before ovulation (in a 28-day cycle, this is is typically day 13).
This estrogen peak tells the brain that the egg has matured and triggers the pituitary gland to release a surge of luteinizing hormone (LH).
The LH Surge:
This LH surge acts as a cue to the ovarian follicle.
About 24-36 hours after the LH surge , a mature egg breaks out of the ovary and is released into the fallopian tube -- this is ovulation.
The egg leaves behind the corpus luteum (the empty follicle).
Hormones and the Luteal Phase:
The Corpus Luteum:
The cells of the corpus luteum release the hormone progesterone. This hormone helps to thicken and prepare your uterine lining for the implantation of a fertilized egg.
The corpus luteum will continue to make progesterone during the luteal phase of your menstrual cycle -- which is around 12-16 days.
After ovulation, if your egg is fertilized, the corpus luteum will continue to make progesterone to help sustain your pregnancy until the placenta is ready to do this job. 
The Shrinking of the Corpus Luteum:
If, after ovulation, the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum will begin to shrink.
It stops making progesterone -- which leads to no more hormones being made to support the uterine lining.
The lining will begin to shed off.
This leads the start of your monthly period.
The low levels of estrogen and progesterone will then signal the hypothalamus to start the whole menstrual cycle process over again.

[...]","The context explains that luteinizing hormone (LH) plays a key role in triggering ovulation. It mentions that the LH surge signals the ovarian follicle to release the mature egg, directly linking LH to the control of ovulation. This is the primary hormone responsible for initiating the process.",40,1,1,1,1,1

Updated March 14, 2016.
Question: What Is the Most Abundant Gas in the Earth's Atmosphere?
The Earth's atmosphere or air is composed of several gases. One gas is much more abundant than any other. Can you guess which one it is?
Answer: By far, the most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere is nitrogen , which accounts for about 78% of the mass of dry air. Oxygen is the next most abundant gas, present at levels of 20-21%. Although humid air seems like it contains a lot of water, the maximum amount of water vapor that air can hold is only about 4%.
Abundance of Gases in the Atmosphere
This table lists the eleven most abundant gases in the lower portion of Earth's atmosphere (up to 25 km). While the percentage of nitrogen and oxygen are fairly stable, the amount of greenhouse gases changes and depends on location. Water vapor is extremely variable. In arid or extremely cold regions, water vapor may be nearly absent. In warm, tropical regions, water vapor accounts for a significant portion of atmospheric gases.

The average concentration of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxde, methane, and nitrous dioxide has been increasing. Ozone is concentrated around cities and in the Earth's stratosphere. In addition to the elements in the table and krypton, xenon, nitrogen dioxide, and iodine (all mentioned earlier), there are trace amounts of ammonia, carbon monoxide, and several other gases.
Why Is Important To Know the Abundance of Gases?
It's important to know which gas is most abundant, what the other gases are in the Earth's atmosphere, and how the composition of air changes with altitude and over time for multiple reasons. The information helps us understand and predict the weather. The amount of water vapor in air is particularly relevant to weather forecasting. The gas composition helps us understand the effects of natural and manmade chemicals released into the atmosphere. The make-up of the atmosphere is extremely important for climate, so changes in gases may help us predict broad climate change.

Evidence for nutrient enrichment of high-elevation lakes in the Sierra Nevada, California Evidence for nutrient enrichment of high-elevation lakes in the Sierra Nevada, California Limnology and Oceanography Download citation as: RIS Abstract Long-term measurements (1983-2001) of nutrients and seston in Emerald Lake (Sierra Nevada, California) have revealed ecologically significant patterns. Nitrate, both during spring runoff and during growing seasons, declined from 1983 through 1995. Declining snowmelt nitrate was caused primarily by changes in snow regime induced by the 1987-1992 drought: years with shallow, early melting snowpacks had lower snowmelt nitrate concentrations owing to less labile N production in catchment soils and longer plant growing seasons. However, nitrate declines during growing seasons carried through the wetter years of 1993-2000 and are likely the result of increased P loading to the lake and the release of phytoplankton from P limitation. Contemporaneous with these changes was an increase in algal biomass and a shift from P limitation toward more frequent N limitation of phytoplankton abundance. Particulate carbon concentrations in the late 1990s were two- to threefold greater than in the early 1980s. These trends were reflected in a larger set of Sierra Nevada lakes sampled as part of synoptic surveys (n = 28). Between 1985 and 1999, nitrate decreased and total P increased in >70% of the lakes sampled. Our data suggest that lakes throughout the Sierra Nevada are experiencing measurable eutrophication in response to the atmospheric deposition of nutrients. Additional publication details Nutrient enrichment and criteria Nutrient enrichment and criteria Nuisance plant growth is noted in streams across the nation because of elevated concentrations of nutrients. In fact, concentrations of phosphorus exceeded the USEPA desired goal for phosphorus for preventing nuisance plant growth in streams (0.1 parts per million) in about 75 percent of agricultural and urban streams sampled by the NAWQA Program. It is difficult and premature, however, to attempt a national summary of the effects of eutrophication because methodologies are limited for deriving criteria based only on nutrient concentrations. In recognition of these limitations, USEPA, in collaboration with USGS and other federal agencies, and state agencies, is developing a strategy to evaluate aquatic plant growth and to develop an understanding of stream nutrient dynamics, stream habitat (including shading and temperature), turbidity, and algal-growth processes. We will work with states and tribes to develop a methodology for deriving criteria, as well as developing criteria where data are available, for nitrogen and phosphorus runoff for lakes, rivers, and estuaries by the year 2000. We intend to develop such criteria on a regional basis using scientifically defensible data and analysis of nutrients, such as those available from the USGS. We will assist states and tribes in adopting numerical nutrient criteria as water-quality standards by the end of 2003 (Robert Cantilli, Nutrients Criteria Coordinator, USEPA, U.S. Geological Survey Circular 1225 , 1999). NAWQA also works with individual states on nutrient standards and criteria. State of Louisiana�USGS works with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality to develop nutrient criteria using NAWQA information on chlorophyll a in the Acadian-Pontchartrain Basins. According to Louisiana Department officials, ""The largest, most consistent source of chlorophyll a data for Louisiana comes from NAWQA sites.� State of Texas�NAWQA data for nutrients collected in the Trinity River Basin are used by the Trinity River Authority to develop nutrient criteria for streams. Factors affecting nutrient enrichment NAWQA information is used to assess factors affecting eutrophication, both regionally and locally. Mississippi River Basin and the Gulf of Mexico� NAWQA scientists participate in a multi-agency effort, coordinated by the White House Committee on Environmental Natural Resources (CENR), to assess nutrient enrichment, eutrophication, and the effects of hypoxia (low oxygen conditions) in the Gulf of Mexico. Specifically, NAWQA is modeling sources and transport of nutrients using a spatially referenced computer model throughout the Mississippi River watershed. The model tracks the sources (including point sources, fertilizer, livestock wastes, nonagricultural land, and atmospheric deposition) and movement of nutrients in individual stream reaches across the watershed. The effort has demonstrated key roles that hydrology and natural processes play in the transport of nutrients to, and eutrophication in, the Gulf of Mexico. Specifically, closer proximity of nitrogen sources to large streams and rivers increases the transport of nutrients to the Gulf. This is because nitrogen is not removed as readily in the large streams and rivers by natural processes as in the smaller tributaries and is, therefore, much more likely to reach a coastal area if it originates close to a larger river. As a result, some watersheds in the Mississippi River Basin are much more significant contributors of nitrogen to the Gulf of Mexico than others, despite similar nitrogen sources or similar distances from the Gulf. State of North Carolina�NAWQA findings are used by the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources to help control excessive nutrients and resulting algal blooms, fish kills, and Pfiesteria incidents in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico Rivers. For example, the findings led to the implementation of buffers in the Neuse River, which proved to effectively reduce nutrient runoff to the surface water. In addition, NAWQA research on the role of organic matter in streambed sediment in removing nitrate from ground water in some areas of the Coastal Plain has allowed the State to prioritize its efforts in streams where elevated nitrate is not as easily removed under natural conditions. The St. Croix National Scenic Riverway (NSR) was established in 1968 under the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. In the early 1990�s continued development and usage of the St. Croix River concerned water resource managers about the impact on water quality. Research from the NAWQA Program provided evidence that nutrient loading from the tributaries was increasing the rate of eutrophication in Lake St. Croix, a sink of the St. Croix River Basin. In response to these threats, a cooperative agreement was signed in 1993 by the National Park Service, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. To date, the partnership that was formed (St. Croix Basin Water Resources Planning Team) has relied heavily on data from NAWQA to implement a protection strategy for the St. Croix River (Pam Davis, Coordinator, St. Croix Basin Water Resource Planning Team, March 2001).","The context explicitly mentions ""eutrophication"" as the term associated with nutrient enrichment in lakes, such as in the abstract of the first search result and in the third search context.

The Angels: Morning Stars of Creation
THE ANGELS: MORNING STARS OF CREATION
Pascal P. Parente
(Chapter One of the book ""The Angels,"" by Pascal P. Parente)
 
Pure spirits, the closest image and likeness of the Creator, were the     effect of a divine act of creation. A spirit world was produced, at once, in its fullness     and in its grandeur. When, at the word of the Almighty, light's first rays lit up the     primeval, shapeless world, still ""wrapped in a mist as in swaddling clothes,"" a     wondrous song, a joyful melody filled the new heavens with never-ending strains. The Lord     recalls these primordial times when He asks: ""Where wast thou when I laid the     foundations of the earth? . . . When the morning stars praised me together, and all the     sons of God made joyful melody.""[1] These ""sons of God,"" living witnesses     of the creation of the material universe, were our Angels, the morning stars of creation.
It is an article of faith, firmly established in Scripture and     Tradition, and clearly expressed in Christian Doctrine from the beginning, that this     spirit world, our Angels, began with time and was created by God. This traditional belief     of both the Old and the New Testament was given a more formal and solemn expression in the     fourth Lateran Council in 1215: (God) ""by his almighty power created together in the     beginning of time both creatures, the spiritual and the corporeal, namely the Angelic and     the earthly, and afterwards the human, as it were an intermediate creature, composed of     body and spirit.""[2]
From this definition we learn that the Angelic spirits were created when     time began and not from eternity. Like all other creatures they were produced by the     almighty power of God, out of nothing. It would be heretical to affirm that the Angels are     an emanation of the divine substance.[3] Spiritual substances do not divide or split or     multiply in any form whatever, nor change one into another; their individual existence can     only be explained by creation.
The creation of the Angels is implicitly affirmed in all those passages     of Sacred Scripture in which it is stated that all things were made by God; explicitly and     formally their creation is mentioned by Saint Paul in one of those incomplete enumerations     of the Angelic orders: ""In Him (the Son of God, the Logos) were all things created in     heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether Thrones, or Dominations, or     Principalities, or Powers: all things were created by Him and in Him.""[4]
Creation itself is a revealed truth, not so the exact time when the     Angels were created. Nothing definite can be determined on this point from Sacred     Scripture. Neither Jewish nor Christian Tradition agrees on the time when the spirit     world, our Angels, came into existence. With many of the Fathers of the Church we believe     as very probable that the Angels were created long before the material world. They were     certainly created before man, because we find them already distinguished as good Angels     and fallen angels on man's first appearance on earth.[5]
This circumstance would seem to imply that a long time, one or more     cosmic period, had elapsed from the time of their creation. It does not seem probable that     God, Who created this world for His own glory, would have no created intelligences to     witness the awe-inspiring act of its making. The passage from Job quoted above seems to     prove that such witnesses did exist. They saw the marvelous manifestations of the Divine     Wisdom, Power, and Goodness and praised the Lord, filling the heavens with ""joyful     melody."" Man himself was not there at the beginning of creation to give glory to God;     some created intelligence must have been present. The Angels were the first splendors     created to reflect the glory of the Eternal. The first creative act must have produced a     creature to the image and similitude of God, a creature able to understand, love, thank,     and praise God. When the whole material world had been created, the Lord formed another     similar creature, ""a little less than the Angels,"" consisting of body and spirit, able to know, love, and serve Him on earth as the Angels do in heaven. We like to     imagine the creation of the material universe placed between the creations of two orders     of rational beings. One, heavenly, purely spiritual: the Angels; one, earthly, partly     material, partly spiritual: Man.[6]

The Milky Way galaxy is most significant to humans because it is home sweet home. But when it comes down to it, our galaxy is a typical barred spiral, much like billions of other galaxies in the universe. Let's take a look at the Milky Way.
Location, location, location
A glance up at the night sky reveals a broad swath of light. Described by the ancients as a river, as milk, and as a path, among other things, the band has been visible in the heavens since Earth first formed. In reality, this intriguing line of light is the center of our galaxy, as seen from one of its outer arms.
The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy, about 100,000 light-years across. If you could look down on it from the top, you would see a central bulge surrounded by four large spiral arms that wrap around it. Spiral galaxies make up about two-third of the galaxies in the universe. [ Infographic: Our Milky Way Galaxy: A Traveler's Guide ]
This picture of the nearby galaxy NGC 6744, a Milky Way look-alike, was taken with the Wide Field Imager on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at La Silla.

Unlike a regular spiral, a barred spiral contains a bar across its center region, and has two major arms . The Milky Way also contains two significant minor arms, as well as two smaller spurs. One of the spurs, known as the Orion Arm, contains the sun and the solar system. The Orion arm is located between two major arms, Perseus and Sagittarius.
The Milky Way does not sit still, but is constantly rotating. As such, the arms are moving through space. The sun and the solar system travel with them. The solar system travels at an average speed of 515,000 miles per hour (828,000 kilometers per hour). Even at this rapid speed, the solar system would take about 230 million years to travel all the way around the Milky Way.
Curled around the center of the galaxy, the spiral arms contain a high amount of dust and gas. New stars are constantly formed within the arms. These arms are contained in what is called the disk of the galaxy. It is only about 1,000 light-years thick. [ Photo Gallery: Stunning Photos of Our Milky Way Galaxy ]
At the center of the galaxy is the galactic bulge . The heart of the Milky Way is crammed full of gas, dust, and stars. The bulge is the reason that you can only see a small percentage of the total stars in the galaxy. Dust and gas within it are so thick that you can't even peer into the bulge of the Milky Way, much less see out the other side.

The Primary Colors
 
The primary colors of light are red, green, and blue. 
Red, blue, and green are the primary colors of light. Mixing these colors can produce all of the colors of the spectrum.
 
The   Complementary Colors
The complementary colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow which are formed by combining the two adjacent primary colors. Red and blue make magenta, blue and green make cyan, and red and green make yellow.
The   Color Wheel
The primary and complementary colors combine to make the Color Wheel. Clockwise from the top the colors are: yellow, green, cyan, blue, magenta and red. On the Color Wheel, harmonizing colors are adjacent. Contrasting colors are separated by another color. Red and green are contracting colors. Colors that clash are opposite on the wheel - green and magenta for example.
 
The hue is the basic color that distinguishes one color from another - blue from red for example.
Saturation is the purity of hue. A saturated blue, for example, is composed only of pure blue color. Hues can become desaturated by the addition of either black (shadow) or white (light). Adding light makes the color more pale, producing a tint. Adding black, by covering the color with a shadow, gives a shade. In the diagram below the center wheel has pure fully saturated color. As you move to the left black is added to produce shades. As you move to the right white is added to produce tints.
The luminance of a color is the characteristic we describe when we say a color is light or dark. A bright color seems to reflect more light than a dark one.","The context explicitly states that the primary colors of light are red, green, and blue. This directly answers the question about the three primary colors of light.",24,1,1,1,1,1

How can I display the value of Pi to three decimal places by using conditional formatting to avoid rounding numbers up or down? Use the Fixed-Point (“F”) Format Specifier , and specify the number of desired decimal places. The following technique uses the Windows PowerShell format operator. PS C:\> “{0:F3}” -f [math]::PI 3.142 Pi, a Very Special Number : nrich.maths.org Pi, a Very Special Number Stage: 2 and 3 Article by NRICH team Published February 2004,February 2011. $\pi$ is the symbol used for a special number which we call pi (pronounced ""pie""). $\pi$ comes from working with circles. $\pi$ is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. This means that you can work out $\pi$ by dividing the distance around a circle by the length of its diameter. The strange thing is that on a calculator the answer you get can only ever be approximate - that is, you can't show an exact value for pi with digits on a calculator screen or even on large pieces of paper. This has fascinated mathematicians for a very long time and they have kept trying to find ways to calculate approximations of pi that are more and more accurate. $\pi$ is needed to find the area of a circle using the formula $\pi{r}^{2}$ To work out the area of a circle you need to use an approximate value for pi (like $3.14$) then multiply that by the radius of the circle squared. For example; if the radius was $5 \; \text{cm}$, the area would be approximately $3.14 \times 5 \times 5 \times 78.5$ square centimetres. What is the value of Pi? In the Old Testament of the Bible (I Kings 7:23) it is suggested that $\pi$ is equal to $3$. The Babylonians, in about 2000 BC, use $3$ or $3 1/8$. In the ancient Rhind papyrus, the Egyptian scribe Ahmes said that $\pi$ was equal to $16/9$ squared. This calculates to $3.16049 \ldots$. Archimedes worked on the problem of finding $\pi$ by calculating the area of regular polygons, with up to $96$ sides. He decided that $\pi$ was somewhere between $310/71$ and $310/70$. In decimals this would be $3.14085 \ldots$ and $3.142857 \ldots$ (remember the decimal places keep going on and on). Over the centuries, many mathematicians, such as Ptolemy (the ancient Greek astronomer), Tsu Ch'ung-Chi (of China) and Ludolph van Ceulen (of Germany) kept trying to find more accurate values for pi using a variety of different methods. During the last few centuries people have been trying to find as many decimal places as possible so they can look for patterns in the long string of digits. In 1949 a computer was used to calculate pi to $2\;037$ places. In 1967 in France $500\;000$ digits were found. In 1983 a Japanese team found $16\;777\;216$ decimal places for pi. The current record is about $51$ billion decimal places. Here are some of the decimal places that have been found: $$\pi = 3.14159 \; 26535 \; 89793 \; 23846 \; 26433 \; 83279 \; 50288 \; 41972 \; \dots$$ To help remember these digits, people like to make up sentences or rhymes, called mnemonics. For example, ""May I have a large container of coffee?"" is quite a famous one for the first eight digits. You work out the numbers by counting the letters in each word. Here's one for the first 31 digits: answer.aliases[0]: three point one four two degrees answer.aliases[1]: 3.142 degrees answer.aliases[2]: 3.142 answer.normalized_aliases[0]: 3 142 degrees answer.normalized_aliases[1]: three point one four two degrees answer.normalized_aliases[2]: 3 142 answer.matched_wiki_entity_name: """" answer.normalized_matched_wiki_entity_name: """" answer.normalized_value: 3 142 answer.type: Numerical answer.value: 3.142","The context explicitly mentions that using the Fixed-Point format specifier in Windows PowerShell displays Pi to three decimal places as 3.142, and also directly states the value as 3.142.

RELATED ARTICLES Share this article Share But it is in stark contrast to the more serious messages of the runner-up ad and third place army recruitment poster. In second place to the sexy bra ad was the Conservative Party's 'Labour Isn't Working' campaign by advertising agency Saatchi and Saatchi which depicted a dole queue to highlight rising unemployment figures. The ad was considered influential in helping Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party sweep to victory in the 1979 General Election. Impact: The Conservative party's influential 'Labour Isn't Working' poster by Saatchi and Saatchi was runner-up in the poll Copied: The 'Your Country Needs You' army recruitment poster featuring Lord Kitchener was voted the third most eye-catching despite being devised almost a century ago In third place was Lord Kitchener's army recruitment poster dating back to World War One. The immediate impact of the poster has seen it copied for almost a century since its first use in 1914. More than 10,000 votes were cast to identify the most striking images to feature in the Outdoor Hall Of Fame, launched in conjunction with ad industry magazine Campaign.

The last verse has a bit about crushing the rebellious Scots that doesn't really make sense any more. Paul_Rook answers: there were 6 verses to the anthum as previously said but GOD SAVE THE QUEEN is sung in the United Kingdom as a matter of tradition. It has never been proclaimed the national anthem by an Act of Parliament or a Royal Proclamation. Lyrics God save our gracious Queen Long live our noble Queen, God save the Queen: A complete guide to God Save The Queen – Royal Central Getting to know Timothy Laurence As a royalist, I feel having a national anthem about our Queen is a fantastic thing. Republicans argue (they always do) that God Save The Queen shouldn’t be Britain’s anthem because it’s ‘all about The Queen’ – we’ll come onto why that’s not the case in just a minute, though I thought I’d take this opportunity to go back a few centuries to see how the song (and then anthem) came into existence. In 1745, the patriotic song God Save The King was performed in London for the first time. The lyrics, rather different to what we know as God Save The Queen these days, but the tune – unmistakably that of the anthem. The song was actually written as a rallying cry around the King after the defeat of his army at Prestopans by that of the ‘Young Pretender’ – Charles Edward Stuart, now more commonly known as Bonnie Prince Charlie. Starting in a theatre in London, before spreading to others across the country, the practice of playing God Save The King at the end of performances became de rigueur and eventually the tune was adopted as the official national anthem of Great Britain. To this day the tune remains the anthem of the United Kingdom and also of some of the other realms with Her Majesty as Head of State. The tune to God Save The King even forms the basis to some other countries’ national songs including America’s My Country is of Thee, The Norwegian Royal Anthem and even the national anthem of Liechtenstein! The anthem has moved with the times and in 1952, (as in 1837) was modified from God Save The King to God Save The Queen, on Her Majesty’s accession to the throne – ever since she has doubtless heard it thousands of times, yet the only one she was apparently genuinely moved by was Benjamin Britten’s rendition of the anthem, first played in the 1960s and played annually at Last Night of the Proms (below). Nowadays, despite no official record of the anthem’s current verses existing, through tradition and persistence of use, 6 verses have been ‘adopted’ as the de facto official anthem (see below). Typically, only the first verse is sung though on occasion a second verse may be sung (when two verses are sung, it’s verses 1 and 3) and on rare occasions, all of the first three verses may be used. Almost never are any of the other 3 verses used. In fact, most Britons know the first verse and part of the second verse, though as a general rule that’s enough to get by on most occasions – the anthem is quite slow in comparison to other nations’ anthems, so typically just the first verse is used because of this. Two verses are used in the presence of Her Majesty usually. Verse 6 holds a special place with the national anthem in that it can never be used. References to ‘crushing Scots’ are to blame for the neglect of this verse.","The context explicitly states that there are six verses to the anthem, but only the first three are typically sung. It also mentions that the first verse is usually sung, and on rare occasions, the third verse is sung. The answer is derived from the context's statement that only the first three verses are commonly used, even though there are six in total.",51,1,1,1,1,1

Top Ten Visitor Attractions in Alaska
1.  Denali National Park
The Denali National Park experience is fascinating and memorable for a number of reasons. First, of course, is magnificent Mount McKinley, which at 20,320 feet is the highest peak in North America. Then there's the wildlife. Take one of Denali National Park's bus tours and you're likely to see grizzly bears, moose, caribou, Dall sheep, and wolves. Finally, there's the gorgeous and varied color of the park's lakes and rivers, geologic formations, and tundra landscape. Spend time at the Denali Visitor Center, located at the park's northeast entrance, to learn about the seasons and the natural history of Denali, and to get information about available park tours, activities, and recreation.

Citrus fruits, such as grapefruit, contain citric acid. The exact amount of citric acid in one grapefruit will depend on a number of factors, most importantly the size of the fruit itself. By weight, grapefruits provide more citric acid than oranges but less than lemons or limes.
Citric Acid Content
Grapefruit juice contains about 25 grams of citric acid per liter, or 1,000 grams, of juice, according to a study published in the ""Journal of Endourology"" in March 2008. Each small grapefruit contains about 182 grams of juice, which means it has approximately 5 grams of citric acid. A medium grapefruit has about 233 grams of juice, so it provides approximately 6 grams of citric acid, and a large grapefruit contains about 302 grams of juice and provides approximately 8 grams of citric acid.

Cocktail Science: 8 Tips and Tricks For Getting the Most Out of Citrus
10
[Photo: Kevin Liu]
It wasn't that long ago that bartenders would reach for a suspect-looking bottle of store-bought lemon juice or sour mix any time a cocktail calling for citrus was ordered. The recent cocktail renaissance has brought back a much-needed appreciation for fresh juices.
But to really capture the complex flavors of lemons, limes, oranges, and grapefruits, you have to think beyond just juice. Today, we look at some sweet suggestions for getting the most out of these sour fruits.
1. Fresh is not always best
Cocktail guru Dave Arnold first reported that lime juice that had been sitting for 4 hours tasted better to a panel of blind taste-testers than fresh lime juice.
We still don't have a bulletproof scientific explanation for why this happens, but quite a few people have demonstrated similar results.
I've tested the phenomenon myself and came to these conclusions:*
Orange juice: fresh is, in fact, best. An unpleasant bitterness develops just 30 minutes after juicing.
Lime and Lemon juice: aged for 4 to 10 hours is best. Juice aged four hours did seem to taste more mellow while the top notes seemed to pop a little more. After 10 hours of storage, the juices seemed to lose some of their aroma, and after a day of storage bitterness became noticeable and unpleasant.
Grapefruit juice: aged for 1 to 3 days is best. Juice held for a day was noticeably more bitter, but that actually made the juice taste more grapefruit-ey. After three days, the juice tasted like it had lost much of its aroma, though the bitterness still wasn't overpowering.
Here's what I think is going on.** What's behind both the increased bitterness in juice and the improved taste in aged juice is the bitter chemical limonin. There's almost no limonin in fresh-squeezed lemon and lime juices, but some precursor chemicals of limonin are present. When fresh juice is exposed to air, enzymes convert those precursors into bitter limonin, a process known as enzymatic bittering.
Why would bitterness make juice taste better? In very small amounts, bitterness has a suppressive effect on the other basic tastes.*** In 4-hour-old juice, I think the bitterness is suppressing some of the intense acidity in lemon and lime juices, which allows the drinker to perceive more of the subtle nuances of the juice's flavor.
Is it worth it to intentionally age juice for a tiny improvement in quality? I would argue probably not. The real takeaway from these observations is that if you do have to do some of your juice-prep work a few hours in advance of a party, your cocktail quality won't suffer (with the one exception of orange juice.)
[...]","The context explicitly mentions that citrus fruits such as grapefruit, lemons, oranges, and limes contain citric acid. It also provides specific details about the amount of citric acid in grapefruit juice, confirming that citric acid is the type of acid extracted from these fruits.",51,1,1,1,1,1

A Brief History of Animals in Space
Before humans actually went into space, one of the prevailing theories of the perils of space flight was that humans might not be able to survive long periods of weightlessness. For several years, there had been a serious debate among scientists about the effects of prolonged weightlessness. American and Russian scientists utilized animals - mainly monkeys, chimps and dogs - in order to test each country's ability to launch a living organism into space and bring it back alive and unharmed.
On June 11, 1948, a V-2 Blossom launched into space from White Sands, New Mexico carrying Albert I, a rhesus monkey. Lack of fanfare and documentation made Albert an unsung hero of animal astronauts. On June 14, 1949, a second V-2 flight carrying a live Air Force Aeromedical Laboratory monkey, Albert II, attained an altitude of 83 miles. The monkey died on impact. On August 31, 1950, another V-2 was launched and carried an unanaesthetized mouse that was photographed in flight and did not survive impact. On December 12, 1949, the last V-2 monkey flight was launched at White Sands. Albert IV, a rhesus monkey attached to monitoring instruments, was the payload. It was a successful flight, with no ill effects on the monkey until impact, when it died.
On September 20, 1951, a monkey named Yorick and 11 mice were recovered after an Aerobee missile flight of 236,000 feet at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. Yorick got a fair amount of press as the first monkey to live through a space flight.

English language reference work
William Benton
Encyclopædia Britannica, the oldest English-language general encyclopaedia . The Encyclopædia Britannica was first published in 1768, when it began to appear in Edinburgh , Scotland .
The following account sketches the development of the Encyclopædia Britannica from its Scottish beginnings to its established position as a major English-language work of reference with editorial offices in Chicago and thousands of contributors worldwide.
First edition
The first edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica was published and printed in Edinburgh for the engraver Andrew Bell and the printer Colin Macfarquhar by “a society of gentlemen in Scotland” and was sold by Macfarquhar at his printing office on Nicolson Street. The work was issued from December 1768 to 1771 with double-columned pages. The parts were bound in three stout quarto volumes of some 2,500 pages, with 160 copperplate engravings by Bell, and dated 1771. The title page begins as follows: “Encyclopædia Britannica; or, a Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, compiled upon a new plan.” The work could not compete in bulk with the 68 volumes of Johann Heinrich Zedler’s Universal Lexicon or with the French Encyclopédie , whose 17 volumes of text had recently been completed. But it did challenge comparison with all previous dictionaries of arts and sciences, large or small, because of its new plan.

Pac-Man Championship Edition DX
Ms. Pac-Man & Jr. Pac-Man
Clyde is replaced by Sue in Ms. Pac-Man and Tim in Jr. Pac-Man , though they are depicted as identical to Clyde.
Pac-Land
Based on the Pac-Man animated series , Pac-Land features Clyde and the other ghosts including Sue as they try to stop Pac-Man using various methods, including vehicles.
Pac-Man Arrangement
In the remake of the original Pac-Man, Pac-Man Arrangement , Clyde and Blinky's names were swapped, similar to the pair in the Pac-Man World series. Clyde had the ability to become a large ghost who spits out 20-point dots at times in the maze after merging with Kinky , as well as placing Power Pellets down, prolonging each stage for the player. Clyde also appears as the final boss alongside the other ghosts inside a giant robot.
Pac-Man Remix
Clyde is a normal enemy in Pac-Man Remix, appearing in every level with his basic abilities, as well as three boss battles. Clyde is the game's 4th boss and he, like the other ghosts makes himself giant, as well as piloting a giant bulldozer to attack Pac-Man with. His only attack is charging at Pac-Man with the dozer, an attack easy to avoid. he can be damaged by eating a power pellet, transforming the giant Clyde into 20 vulnerable ghosts, the player must eat as many of these as they can before Clyde becomes big again. The more you eat, the smaller Clyde will get until he is normal size. When he's normal, he will abandon the bulldozer and attack Pac-Man normally and eat him to defeat him. Clyde makes himself big for the game's 5th boss, in which all the giant ghosts attack Pac-Man together. Blinky and Pinky will attack Pac-Man solo, but Clyde and Inky attack him together. Clyde is one of the pilots of the robotic Mega-Ghost, the game's final boss.
Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures
Clyde, Pinky, Blinky, and Inky appear as enemies for Pac-Man in Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures , petrifying him whenever they appear. Unless Pac-Man is able to get a Power Pellet , he will faint. Occasionally, Clyde or the others will leave important items behind after they are eaten. After their leader, the Ghost Witch of Netor is defeated, Clyde and the others fly off.

Clyde and the ghosts allied themselves with Orson , who plotted to defeat Pac-Man once and for all. The ghosts aided Orson and his Toc-Man robot to capture Pac-Man's friends and family including Ms. Pac , Baby Pac , Jr. Pac , Professor Pac , Chomp-Chomp and Pooka . Soon after, a ghost discovered Pac-Man arriving on Ghost Island , to which Toc-Man reprimanded Clyde for failing to capture him. Clyde protested, saying they caught Ms. Pac by mistake. He later fled with the rest of the ghosts after Pac-Man appeared.
Pac-Man World 2
Clyde's Frog
Main article: Blinky's  Killer Frog Clyde, along with Blinky, Pinky and Inky stole the Golden Fruit from Pac-Land , revealing Spooky . He is the first boss of the game. The arena looks like a small, dried up pond. In order to defeat Pac-Man, Clyde made a giant frog-like robot. It has only one attack method which involves sticking out its tongue (he calls it his ""big froggie tongue"".) The tongue has a spiked ball attached to the end which inflicts damage to Pac-Man. He is the only ghost to have a different machine than the others. He later joins them as the boss of the fifth world in their Megawhale!
Pac-Man World 3
Clyde, along with Inky is captured by Erwin in attempt to siphon the ghosts' energy. He uses their energy to power his Teratron and keeps them in tubes. They both argue over who gets siphoned first. The two ghosts are eventually rescued by Blinky, Pinky, and Pac-Man. Clyde was voiced by Martin Sherman.

Three for joy: Reunion of Magpie presenters after 29 years apart
For a generation of children in the 1970s, they were the cooler, trendier alternative to the BBC’s conservative Blue Peter.
Inevitably, these days the jawlines are slacker and the hair less luxuriant.
But the years rolled away when the three main presenters of ITV children’s classic Magpie were reunited.
Like old times: The presenters of 1970s Magpie - the Blue Peter rival - meet up again
Jenny Hanley, Mick Robertson and Douglas Rae fronted the teatime programme together for three years, pulling in audiences of as much as 10million.
They have remained in occasional contact but all three of them got together for the first time since 1980 at a fete in the Surrey village where Rae lives.
Miss Hanley, now 61, was asked to open the fete and decided to organise the reunion by contacting Robertson, who grew up in the next village.
Prime: Rae (left), Robertson and Hanley
The trio greeted each other with hugs before spending the afternoon chatting about old times.
Miss Hanley said: ‘It is so lovely to see the guys again – as if we last saw each other only yesterday. We worked together for three and a half years and got on so well together back then, and clearly still do now.’
Robertson, 65, said: ‘It is great to see Jenny and Douglas again – we used to really look out for each other.’
Magpie was first broadcast in 1968 and was initially presented by Susan Stranks, Tony Bastable and former Radio 1 DJ Pete Brady.
The show’s mascot was a fat magpie named Murgatroyd. It had rock-based theme music which used the old rhyme about the bird ‘One for sorrow, two for joy’.
Bastable and Brady left Magpie in 1972 and were replaced by Rae and Robertson. Miss Stranks left in 1974 after which Miss Hanley joined.
The only other change came when Tommy Boyd took over from Rae in 1977. All the presenters were invited back for the last episode in 1980.
In her heyday, Miss Hanley’s angelic blue-eyed, blonde look won her a legion of fans, while Robertson looked a bit like a pop star.
Their image was in contrast to Blue Peter rivals such as John Noakes and Peter Purves.
There was tremendous rivalry between the shows with many children branding the BBC’s show as too ‘goody two shoes’ and ‘worthy’.
Magpie concentrated more on pop music, fashion and fun than its public service rival, but still ran charity campaigns and offered viewers badges for good work.
But Rae, 61, who is now a film and television producer, revealed that the rivalry was sometimes friendly, describing how he had a brief fling with Blue Peter star Lesley Judd.
They kept the relationship secret for fear of causing controversy.
‘Lesley was very pretty and, when I met her at a charity function I asked her out for dinner,’ he said.
‘She accepted and we had a bit of a fling. That was the most daring thing I could have done then.’
ITV's flagship childrens magazine programme Magpie
 
 
Unlike its older brother Blue Peter, it started modestly at one show a week but after the first year progressed to two live transmissions, initially. Tuesdays and Thursdays but after a couple of years changing to Tuesdays and Fridays there by not clashing with the Monday and Thursday transmission of Blue Peter.  The show normally came from Thames’s Teddington Studios, were Thames produced their Drama and Light entertainment output  for the ITV network. (The Euston road studios were mainly used for Current Affairs, News ,Transmission and continuity.) The theme tune, performed by ‘The Murgatroyd Band’ ( aka The Spencer Davis Group’)  stayed with the show throughout its life, although the title sequence went through a number of face lifts. It's played regularly on Radio Sounds Familiar.
The songs lyrics were from an old children’s nursery rhyme and went as follows: 
1 for Sorrow
10 for a Bird You Must Not Miss
The Original Line up Pete Brady, Susan Stranks and Tony Bastable 
 The original 3 presenters were Susan Stranks, an unknown actress who  had appeared with Kenneth More in the Film ‘The 39 Steps’ and TV Shows such as Juke Box Jury and Emergency ward 10.

Can We Fix It? by Bob the Builder Songfacts
Songfacts
Bob the Builder was a BBC UK animated TV character whose voice was supplied by the actor Neil Morrissey. The title is derived from Bob the Builder's catch phrase, a question directed to his fellow workers when presented with a challenge.
This was the biggest selling single in the UK in 2000, selling 853,000 copies. It went on to become the most successful single in BBC history, topping 1 million in sales by June 2001 and was also a #1 in Australia.
The composer Paul Joyce was originally in a band called Sense who had a hit single in France called ""Jamie."" In 1989 he turned his attention to writing and performing music for television and he has written theme tunes for many British TV programs. He recalls in 1000 UK #1 Hits by Jon Kutner and Spencer Leigh, ""I wrote the song quite quickly as I was well briefed about what the producers were looking for. The phrase 'Can we fix it' was already established in the script so the challenge was to use it in the song in a way that would be both strong and appeal to kids and adults alike.""
The song's vocalist Neil Morrissey explains in the same publication, ""We had the biggest selling single of the year 2000, which is a nice thing to get, and we were up against all kinds of people. We knocked Eminem off the #1 spot and stopped Westlife matching a Beatles record of 8 straight #1s.""
This song prevented Westlife from having an eighth consecutive UK #1 with ""What Makes A Man,"" which was walled in at #2 by Bob the Builder.
In 2001 Bob The Builder returned to the UK #1 spot with "" Mambo No 5 ,"" a lyrical rewrite of Lou Bega's version of the mambo track which had also hit the top almost exactly 2 years earlier. >>

Actor Neil Morrissey has been axed as the voice of children’s TV programme Bob The Builder.
Neil, 51, spent 14 years working on the BBC1 show as the voice of Bob, his friend Farmer Pickles and a crane named Lofty.
The Men Behaving Badly star achieved two number one singles as the persona of the animated builder and won an Ivor Novello Award for the hit Can We Fix It?
But Neil reveals he has now been dropped by the BBC.
He said: “I have been axed. I have no idea why. They have gone for some cheap person. There should be a public outcry about it.”
The entertainer revealed all in an interview with Piers Morgan for Piers’ new ITV chat show Life Stories, due to air in the new year.
Neil added: “I had two number one singles and won an Ivor Novello Award. I did well out of it and it was regular great work.
""It was the most fun you could have with a microphone.”
He bagged the Christmas Number 1 in 2000 with the show’s hit Can We Fix It?.
And a second single released from the Bob the Builder album – a cover of Mambo No 5 – also topped the charts the following year.

List of Single Word Palindromes

Single Word Palindromes
On this page I've collected a comprehensive list of single word palindromes.
In the spirit of 'single word' I've decided to exclude from this list any palindromic phrases, proper nouns, or hyphenated forms, even though you will encounter these sorts of palindromes in crosswords and other puzzles from time to time.
Unfortunately, this policy means that my page must omit some palindromic gems, like...
AMANAPLANACANALPANAMA — probably the most oft' quoted palindrome of all time, but a phrase nonetheless,
MALAYALAM — the Dravidian language of Kerala, and hence a proper noun, and
RACECAR — a neat word, but strictly a hyphenated form.
...which was, of course, just an excuse to mention them after all ;-)
On the other hand, a pleasant result of these strict criteria is that every word in the list is allowed in Scrabble ! Well, if your adjudicator is the Official International Scrabble Dictionary at least.
Finally, since palindromes of four letters or less are a dime a dozen, I've only included words that are at least five letters long.
And all this banter leaves us with the following single word palindromes...
ALULA
From SEMEME, a unit of meaning.
ROTAVATOR
A soil-tilling machine.
And if you've got a soft spot for palindromes, you'll probably get a giggle out of this brilliant sketch...
Finally, if strange little words like these get your motor running, you'll get a real buzz out of my free book of short words. And you'll start to kick serious butt on the Scrabble board too!

Fruit and vegetables
    Many Egyptians had a garden adjacent to their house, where they grew vegetables and fruit.  Vegetables - the ""crop of the year"" - were grown all year round, irrigated by hand and formed an important part of their diet.
    May the king give an offering (to) Osiris, the great god, that he may grant an invocation offering of bread, beer, cattle, fowl, and every good and pure thing, every kind of vegetable...

Vegetables
    How basic vegetables were on the ordinary Egyptian's menu can be seen in this complaint of striking workers during the reign of Ramses III
    We are starving hungry. Our tongue wasted away in thirst. No cloth is left. We are lacking oil. We have no fish, not even vegetables.
    Onions, which celibate priests were forbidden to eat because of their aphrodisiacal effects, were a staple food.
    On the pyramid (of Cheops) it is declared in Egyptian writing how much was spent on radishes and onions and leeks for the workmen, and if I rightly remember that which the interpreter said in reading to me this inscription, a sum of one thousand six hundred talents of silver was spent;
Herodotus, Histories II, Project Gutenberg
    Garlic was highly valued. According to Pliny Garlic and onions are invoked by the Egyptians , when taking an oath, in the number of their deities. Ramses III ordered garlic to be distributed in large quantities in the temples. The Israelites who had become accustomed to the Egyptian diet of bread, fish and vegetables, complained when they were wandering in the desert [ 3 ]
    5   We remember the fish , which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick.
Numbers 11
    Leeks [ 6 ] are also mentioned in the Ebers papyrus and in the Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor the narrator found all kinds of food on his deserted island:
    When I grew hungry and looked about for food, I found all ready for me within easy reach: figs and grapes, all manner of good herbs, berries and grain, melons of all kinds, fishes and birds for the taking.
Egyptian melon, faience
Middle Kingdom
Source: Keimer, op.cit
    Radishes, choriander, cabbages, endive [ 7 ], cucumbers,  watermelons, melons [ 13 ] and raphanus, a wild  radish tasting like turnip, were grown widely. According to Athenaeus the Egyptians ate boiled cabbage before all the rest of the food considering it one of the most delicate vegetables. The tubercular Arum colocasia, one of the plants loosely referred to as lotus, was also relished [ 5 ]. Mallow was added to soups [ 12 ].
    The poor ate the roots of papyrus and other plants gathered in the marshes. The lotos mentioned by Herodotus with its round root was possibly the White Lotus .
    When the river has become full and the plains have been flooded, there grow in the water great numbers of lilies, which the Egyptians call lotos; these they cut with a sickle and dry in the sun, and then they pound that which grows in the middle of the lotos and which is like the head of a poppy, and they make of it loaves baked with fire. The root also of this lotos is edible and has a rather sweet taste: it is round in shape and about the size of an apple.
Herodotus, Histories II, 2.92
Project Gutenberg
    A second 'lily' variety Herodotus describes was probably the Sacred Lotus , Nelumbo nucifera, an import from India, and not the traditionally depicted blue lotus.
    There are other lilies too, in flower resembling roses, which also grow in the river, and from them the fruit is produced in a separate vessel springing from the root by the side of the plant itself, and very nearly resembles a wasp's comb: in this there grow edible seeds in great numbers of the size of an olive-stone, and they are eaten either fresh or dried. Besides this they pull up from the fens the papyrus which grows every year, and the upper parts of it they cut off and turn to other uses, but that which is left below for about a cubit in length they eat or sell: and those who desire to have the papyrus at its very best bake it in an oven heated red-hot, and then eat it.

It is with deepest sadness that I have to tell you that my husband Neil died suddenly at home on Monday 20th July. He was sitting at his desk updating this website, as he did every morning of his life.
I cannot express the pain of losing this wonderful man but I know he died doing something that he loved. He began this hobby exactly 54 years ago at the age of 12, typing up transfer information he'd read from cigarette cards.

This   CD Rom contains   player’s full names, d.o.b.s, season by season appearances/goals   (including Scottish FA cup and League Cup matches). Individual International   honours are also detailed game by game and current players are listed with   current clubs. In addition Own Goals are listed to keep a record of the total   goals scored each season for complete goal scoring records.
In addition many other   Scottish Football Historical publications are also available from the above   website.
 
Note that for Scottish League records I have only   included teams in Divisions A and B prior to the League reorganisation   in the 1955/56 season. Division C teams records are excluded as the   majority of clubs competing in this league were reserve teams from the A & B Divisions. For a full explanation of the events leading up to the   reorganisation in 1955/56 read HERE . (   an article kindly provided by Alan Bell - Berwick Rangers historian).

SCOTTISH LEAGUE PLAYER'S PLACES AND DATES OF BIRTH
Prior   to the publication of the 1st edition of the Scottish Football League Review   in 1982/83 the places and dates of birth of Scottish League footballers were   not widely published.

If you are one of   these players or are related to or are a friend of one of these players   please e-mail pambrown1956.pb@gmail.com and I   will complete a full record.
I   would also be delighted to hear from any fans ( or ex - players) concerning   those players who have a ' ? ' in the 'Transferred to' column (   this means I don't know what happened to these players when they left the   clubs ).

John Sullivan wrote the theme music for Only Fools and Horses when he wrote the first series, but the producers opted instead for an instrumental, saxophone-led tune composed by Ronnie Hazlehurst, who had also arranged the themes for other BBC sit-coms, such as Yes Minister and Last of the Summer Wine. However, Sullivan was unhappy with this, so for the second series he persuaded the BBC to use his own compositions instead, partly because the new lyrics would explain the obscure title, which had been the subject of viewers' questions to the BBC during the first series.
The first series was subsequently re-edited to use the new theme songs, though the first episode, ""Big Brother"", is still sometimes repeated with the original Hazlehurst music intact, as is the 1981 Christmas special. The current DVD release of Series One, however, replaces the theme music on all seven episodes. The original theme music is still used in the first episode during a montage in which Del unsuccessfully conducts business throughout Peckham whilst trying to find Rodney.
The lyrics to the established themes contain both slang and references to British culture, and describe elements of the show. The opening lyrics include ""stick a pony in my pocket"", pony being London slang for 25 pounds sterling;[58] ""fetch the suitcase from the van"" and ""where it all comes from is a mystery"", all references to the Trotters' shady, cash-only business. It ends with the title lyric, ""why do only fools and horses work?"" The closing theme follows suit, describing the dubious goods that the Trotters specialise in, from ""miles and miles of carpet tiles"" to ""Trevor Francis tracksuits""; Francis was an English football player during the 1970s and 1980s. These are ""from a mush in Shepherd's Bush""; mush is slang for a man whose name is unknown and Shepherd's Bush is a West London district.The line ""no income tax, no VAT"" summarises their outlook, before closing with the refrain ""God bless Hooky Street"". Hooky is British slang for something stolen or which has been acquired illegally. The images peeling away was conceived as a metaphor for the Trotters' lifestyle
Both songs are performed by Sullivan, and not – as is sometimes thought – by Nicholas Lyndhurst.Sullivan had intended for Chas & Dave to sing it, since they were an act associated with Cockney-style music, but they were unavailable having just recorded a hit record with ""Ain't No Pleasing You"", so he was persuaded to do it himself by Ray Butt.The new theme was also arranged by Hazlehurst. Chas & Dave did later contribute to the show, performing ""Down to Margate"", the closing credits song for ""The Jolly Boys' Outing"".
The opening credits see images of the three principal actors peel on and off the screen sequentially like adhesive labels. These appear over a background of still photographs of everyday life in South London, including a used car lot and a tower block. The sequence was conceived by graphic designer, Peter Clayton, as a ""metaphor for the vagaries of the Trotters' lifestyle"", whereby money was earned and quickly lost again. The action was shot manually frame by frame, and took around six weeks to complete.
As the series progressed, the sequence was occasionally updated with new footage, but it only ever featured Del, Rodney and either Grandad or Uncle Albert. The 2001–2003 trilogy featured just Del and Rodney. In total, the shots of Del and Rodney were updated three times during the series' run to reflect their ageing, whilst Grandad and Uncle Albert only ever received one version each during their run. The 2001-2003 Christmas specials used the same titles sequences but rendered for broadcast in the now standard 16:9 ratio widescreen.","The context explicitly states that the opening lyrics of the theme tune for ""Only Fools and Horses"" include the line ""stick a pony in me pocket,"" confirming that this TV show's theme tune starts with that line.",27,1,1,1,1,1

Tennis Glossary
Ace -  A serve that the opponent cannot return; as a verb, to serve an ace.
Ad -  Short for advantage; see entries beginning with that word, below.
Advantage - The player who scores the first point after deuce is said to have the advantage, since winning the next point will also win the game.
Advantage court -   The left service court, where the receiver takes service when either player has the advantage.
Advantage in - Indicates that the server has the advantage; also ""ad in""
Advantage out - Indicates that the receiver has the advantage; also ""ad out""

Alley -  One of the areas outside the singles court that come into play in doubles. The alleys are 4 feet wide.
Back court - The area of the court from the baseline to the service line.
Backhand - A stoke made with the hitting arm or arms and racquet across the body. Can be hit with one or two hands.
Backspin - Backward rotation on the ball, caused by drawing the racket strings down during the stroke, that results in a low bounce. On some surfaces, the ball may even bounce back toward the net. Also known as underspin. See also chip; chop.
Band -  The strip of canvas at the top of the net.
Baseline - A line at the end of the court, parallel to the net, that marks the lengthwise boundary of the playing area.
Baseline player - A player who employs a baseline game; aka a grinder.

Closed grip - A grip in which the racket face is tilted downward, toward the court.

Court -  The tennis court is 78 feet long and 27 feet wide for singles, 36 feet wide for doubles. It is divided across the middle by the net. Service lines are marked 21 feet from each side of the net and parallel to it. The area bounded by the singles sidelines and the service line is divided into two equal parts, the service courts, by the center service line, which is halfway between the sidelines and parallel to them. Visit our tennis court dimensions page for more information (diagram included).
Cross-court - Descriptive of a shot that is hit from one side of the court to the other, as well as over the net. For example, the player hits from the right-hand side of the back court to the right-hand side of the opponent's back court.
Deuce -  When players are tied at 40 (three points each), the score is called  ""deuce"". At deuce, a player must win two points in a row to win the game. If the players split the following two points, the score reverts to deuce.

Down the line - Descriptive of a shot that is hit straight from near the sideline, as opposed to a cross-court shot.
Drop Shot - A soft shot that drops just over the net; usually hit with backspin to minimize its bounce. It's most commonly used against an opponent who is playing deep, as contrasted with the chip shot. This shot is most effective on a clay court surface.
Error -  A shot that fails to cross the net or lands out of the court, resulting in loss of the point. See forced error; unforced error .
Face -  The flat area of the racket formed by the strings and bounded by the frame.
Fault -  An invalid service attempt. It is a fault if the serve fails to land in the receiver's service court; if the server swings and misses the ball entirely; or if the serve is made from beyond the baseline or from the wrong side of the center mark. See also: double fault; foot fault; serve.
Fifteen -  The first point of a game for either player or side.

Songfacts
This was the first Who song written by their bass player, John Entwistle. Pete Townshend ordered him to write a song for their second album. To encourage the band to write their own songs, their record company offered them a £500 advance if each member wrote a song on the album.
Entwistle was afraid of spiders as a kid. He wrote this about seeing a spider crawling from the ceiling and squishing it.
Entwistle wrote this as a joke, but it became a concert favorite. It is a fun song that offset many of the more serious Who songs.
This was the only song from the album that they continued to play live.
In the UK, the album was called A Quick One. It was changed to Happy Jack in the US to avoid being offensive.
After he wrote this, Entwistle started wearing a spider medallion at concerts.","The context states that John Entwistle wrote the song about seeing a spider crawling from the ceiling and squishing it, which directly identifies Boris as a spider.",23,1,1,1,1,1

Answer: Duff Beer is a fictional brand of beer in the animated series The Simpsons. It is Homer Simpson's beer of choice. It is a parody of stereotypical American mass-produced beer: poor-quality, cheap, and advertised everywhere. The beer's official spokesperson is Duffman. The show's creators appear to have designed the Duff Beer label for the making of the May 1990 episode ""Some Enchanted Evening"".

Cant get enough of that wondeful duff.ha.classic Hey you are trying to answer trivia question anyway Its D U F F. Simpsons' 'Duff Beer' Will Soon Be Available to Real Life Drinkers Duff Beer for me, Duff Beer for you + READ ARTICLE 21st Century Fox is brewing up a plan to make Duff Beer, Homer Simpson’s fictional drink of choice, into a real and possibly lucrative brand, the company confirmed on Friday. ""I think there’s potential to have Duff everywhere in the world,"" Jeffrey Godsick, president of Fox’s consumer products division, said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. Until recently Fox was sending cease and desist orders to any brewer that infringed on the brand, but now the media company is reportedly preparing to launch a premium lager with a ""caramel aroma"" and just a hint of irony. The label will not include overt references to the The Simpsons. Instead it will faithfully mimic the bottles and cans seen in the show. Unfortunately for American Duff Beer fans, assuming they exist in the real world, the brand will only launch in Chile initially, where illegal copies of Duff Beer have already taken the market by storm. Fox could not confirm a U.S. release, but Fox executives haven’t ruled out the possibility of a domestic homecoming either. Duff Beer | Simpsons Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia Duff's equivalent in Shelbyville is Fudd Beer . Moe Szyslak once tried to sell Homer a can of ""Swedish Duff"", or Düff (a fake beer that Moe made up by himself by adding the umlaut with magic marker). This is not to be confused with ""Scandinavian Düff, the Beer of Danish Kings"" [1] . He also offered ""Malaysian Duff"" [2] , which was made of soy sauce. There was also at least one variation actually from another country and also of implied high-quality called Duffenbraus, although the label stated it was ""semi-imported."" Moe supplied these to Mayor Quimby and Homer Simpson (the latter of whom had been hired as the former's bodyguard thanks to his saving his life at a riot at the Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con ) on the house when the Mayor made an unexpected visit to the Tavern, strongly implied to be to get a bribe to call off a mandatory health inspection. When Bart , Lisa and Selma visit Duff Gardens [3] the gift shop sells Duff Beer Goggles that let you see and hear everything like a drunk. When Bart puts them on, they make Aunt Selma look and sound more attractive. When Homer tours the Duff Brewery in "" Duffless "", a pipeline is seen splitting freshly-brewed beer into the Duff, Duff Dry and Duff Lite tanks, implying they are the same beer with different labels. The tasting room features Duff Dark, Raspberry Duff, and Tartar-Control Duff. There's also Lady Duff for women (presumably regular Duff Beer in a pink can). Duff tie-in products include a Duff Beer Suitcase, Duff ""Gummy Beers"" candy, and Duff Beer Calendars.

St. George, Christian patron ... Famous People Who Died in Lod [traditionally Lydda, Palestine] Famous Religion; St George - Patron Saint of England St George - Patron Saint of England Navigation By  Ben Johnson   |   Comments Every nation has its own ‘Patron Saint’ who in times of great peril is called upon to help save the country from its enemies. St David is the patron saint of Wales, St Andrew of Scotland and St Patrick of Ireland - St George being the patron saint of England. But who was St. George, and what did he do to become England’s Patron Saint? Very little is known about St. George’s life, but it is thought he was a high ranking officer in the Roman army who was killed in around AD 303. It seems that the Emperor Diocletian had St. George tortured to make him deny his faith in Christ. However despite some of the most terrible torture even for that time, St George showed incredible courage and faith and was finally beheaded near Lydda in Palestine. His head was later taken to Rome where it was interred in the church dedicated to him. Stories of his strength and courage soon spread throughout Europe. The best-known story about St. George is his fight with a dragon, but it is highly unlikely that he ever fought a dragon, and even more unlikely that he ever visited England, however his name was known there as early as the eighth-century. In the Middle Ages the dragon was commonly used to represent the Devil. Unfortunately the many legends connected with St. George’s name are fictitious, and the slaying of the ‘Dragon’ was first credited to him in the 12th century. St. George, so the story goes, killed a dragon on the flat topped Dragon Hill in Uffington, Berkshire, and it is said that no grass grows where the dragon’s blood trickled down! It was probably the 12th century Crusaders however who first invoked his name as an aid in battle. King Edward III made him the Patron Saint of England when he formed the Order of the Garter in St. George's name in 1350, and the cult of the Saint was further advanced by King Henry V , at the battle of Agincourt in northern France. Shakespeare made sure that nobody would forget St. George, and has King Henry V finishing his pre-battle speech with the famous phrase, ‘Cry God for Harry, England and St. George!’ King Henry himself, who was both warlike and devout, was thought by his followers to possess many of the saint’s characteristics. The Tomb of St George, Lod, Israel In England St. George’s Day is celebrated, and his flag flown, on his feast day, April 23rd. An interesting piece of trivia - Shakespeare was born on St. George’s Day 1564, and if the story is to be believed, died on St. George’s Day 1616. An appropriate end perhaps for the man who helped to immortalise the Saint in English tradition. St. George - Saints & Angels - Catholic Online Saints & Angels Author and Publisher - Catholic Online Facts Take the Saints Trivia Quiz now! It is uncertain when Saint George was born and historians continue to debate to this day. However, his death date is estimated to be April 23 303 A.D. The first piece of evidence of George's existance appeared within the works of the Bollandists Daniel Papebroch, Jean Bolland, and Godfrey Henschen's Bibliotheca Hagiographica Graeca. George was one of several names listed in the historical text, and Pope Gelasius claimed George was one of the saints ""whose names are justly reverenced among men, but whose actions are known only to God."" George was born to a Gerontios and Polychronia, a Roman officer and a Greek native of Lydda. Both were Christians from noble families of the Anici and George, Georgios in the original Greek, was raised to follow their faith. When George was old enough, he was welcomed into Diocletian's army. by his late 20's, George became a Tribunus and served as an imperial guard for the Emperor at Nicomedia. On February 24, 303 A.D., Diocletian, who hated Christians, announced that every Christian the army passed would be arrested and every other soldier should offer a sacrifice to the Roman gods. George refused to abide by the order and told Diocletian, who was angry but greatly valued his friendship with George's father. When George announced his beliefs before his peers, Diocletian was unable to keep the news to himself. In an effort to save George, Diocletian attempted to convert him to believe in the Roman gods, offered him land, money and slaves in exchange for offering a sacrifice to the Roman gods, and made several other offers that George refused. Finally, after exhausting all other options, Diocletian ordered George's execution. In preparation for his death, George gave his money to the poor and was sent for several torture sessions. He was lacerated on a wheel of swords and required resuscitation three times, but still George did not turn from God. On April 23, 303 A.D., George was decapitated before Nicomedia's outer wall. His body was sent to Lydda for burial, and other Christians went to honor George as a martyr. Saint George and the Dragon There are several stories about George fighting dragons, but in the Western version, a dragon or crocodile made its nest at a spring that provided water to Silene, believed to be modern-day Lcyrene in Libya. The people were unable to collect water and so attempted to remove the dragon from its nest on several ocassions. It would temporarily leave its nest when they offered it a sheep each day, until the sheep disappeared and the people were distraught. This was when they decided that a maiden would be just as effective as sending a sheep. The townspeople chose the victim by drawing straws. This continued until one day the princess' straw was drawn. The monarch begged for her to be spared but the people would not have it. She was offered to the dragon, but before she could be devoured, George appeared. He faced the dragon, protected himself with the sign of the Cross, and slayed the dragon. After saving the town, the citizens abandoned their paganism and were all converted to Christianity. Interesting Facts Saint George stands out among other saints and legends because he is known and revered by both Muslims and Christians. It is said Saint George killed the dragon near the sea in Beirut, thus Saint George bay was named in his honor. Saint George's feast day is celebrated on April 23, but if it falls before Easter, it is celebrated Easter Monday. The Russian Orthodox Church celebrates three St. George feast days each year -April 23 as is expected, November 3, to commemorate the consecration of a cathedral dedicated to him in Lydda, and on November 26, for when a church in Kiev was dedicated to him. In Bulgaria, his feast day is celebrated May 6 with the slaughter and roasting of a lamb. In Egypt, the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria calls St. George the ""Prince of Martyrs"" and celebrates on May 1. There is a second celebration November 17, in honor of the first church dedicated to him. Saint George is the patron saint of England and Catalonia and his cross can be found throughout England. In older works, Saint George is depicted wearing armor and holding a lance or fighting a dragon, which represents Christ's enemies. Prayer for St. George St. George, Heroic Catholic soldier and defender of your Faith, you dared to criticize a tyrannical Emperor and were subjected to horrible torture. You could have occupied a high military position but you preferred to die for your Lord. Obtain for us the great grace of heroic Christian courage that should mark soldiers of Christ.

How many kings are in a deck of cards?
A:
Quick Answer
There are four kings in a standard deck of playing cards. One king belongs to each of the four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades.
Full Answer
The king is the highest ranking of the three face card types. After the king comes the queen and then the jack. In most games, the ace is the highest ranking card and the only card ranked above a king. A standard deck of cards contains 52 total cards that are divided evenly among the four suits. In addition to the face cards and the aces, there are cards in each suit for the numbers two through ten.
Playing Card Frequencies

Playing Card Frequencies
A standard deck of 52 playing cards consists of 4 suits, with 13 kinds in each suit.  In many  card games, the kinds are ranked, and are often referred to as the ranks of the cards.  In some  games, the suits are also ranked.
Image from www.jfritz.com/cards
In the picture above, the four rows are the four suits.  The clubs are all in the first row, followed by the spades, then the hearts, and last the diamonds.  Among the 13 kinds, we find the numbers 2 through 10, and four other kinds.  The A stands for ace,  the J for jack, the Q for queen, and the K for king.  The jack, queen, and king are often referred  to as face cards.
In many card games, a player has a number of cards, and this is referred to as his hand.  In a few  card games, the order in which the cards are received will matter, but more often a player receives  all of the cards for his hand at one time.  It should be noted that when cards make up a hand,   the same card cannot appear twice.  In other words, selections of cards to create a hand are  done ""without replacement"" (that is, without returning the first card to the deck and replacing  it with a second).
Determining Frequencies of Different Events
The number of ways any particular event can happen will depend upon the number of cards that form  a hand.  Let us begin with the simplest possible hand, a single card.  (Most players would not  even consider this a hand, since it has only one card, but mathematicians always include the  extreme cases when creating their definitions.)
The number of ways to have a heart is 13, since there are 13 hearts.
The number of ways to not have a heart is 39, since there are 39 cards that are not hearts.
The number of ways to have a queen is 4, since there are 4 queens.
The number of ways to not have a queen is 48, since there are 48 cards that are not queens.
The number of ways to have a face card is 12, since there are 3 kinds that are face cards,  in four suits each.
When a hand consists of multiple cards, the events are much more interesting.  Suppose a hand  consists of three cards.  There are   ${}_{52} C_3 = 22100$ ways to choose such a hand.
Let us consider a single suit, say hearts.
The number of ways to have three hearts is   ${}_{13} C_3 = 286$,   since any three  hearts can be chosen from the 13 available hearts to make up the hand.
The number of ways to have two hearts and one other card that is not a heart is   $({}_{13} C_2)({}_{39} C_1) = 78 \times 39 = 3328$.   In this computation, we chose 2 of the 13  available hearts, and one of the other 39 cards to make up the hand.
The number of ways to have one heart and two other cards is   $({}_{13} C_1)({}_{39} C_2) = 13 \times 741 = 9633$.   We chose 1 of the 13 hearts, and two of  the other 39 cards to make up the hand.
The number of ways to have no hearts at all is   ${}_{39} C_3 = 9139$,   where we have chosen all 3 cards from the 39 that are not hearts.
It can be verified that the four results above in fact add to 22100, the total number of ways that  something can happen.  The fact that we used hearts as the suit was irrelevant, the same frequencies  would occur if the suit had been spades (or diamonds, or clubs).
We can do variations on that theme as well.
The number of ways to have two hearts and one diamond is   $({}_{13} C_2)({}_{13} C_1) = 78 \times 13 = 1014$.   Here, we chose 2 of the 13 hearts, and  one of the 13 diamonds.
The number of ways to have at least two hearts is   $({}_{13} C_2)({}_{39} C_1) + {}_{13} C_3 = 78 \times 39 + 286 = 3328$.   To do this problem,  we had to break ""at least two"" into the cases ""exactly two"" and ""exactly three"".
[...]","The context mentions that there are four kings in a standard deck of cards, one for each suit. However, it does not provide any information about the physical appearance of the kings, such as whether they have a moustache. Therefore, the answer ""Three"" is not supported by the context provided.",31,0,0,0,0,0

Travel guide - Prague
In Prague, a magical atmosphere reigns. In the capital of the Czech Republic, the skies are populated with thousands of steeples and the houses are locked in an eternal dance. For over a millennium, this city has exuded a delicate architectural alchemy and has built up a cultural mosaic from all over Europe.
Caressed by the waters of the Vltava, the city is lulled by a soundtrack of classical music, as you will find out during your stay in Prague. From     the old city and its maze of narrow streets to Prague Castle, the emblem of the city, Prague is a cultural symphony that can hold its head up high among     the other European capitals.
Sample the bohemian magic and explore the romantic side of Prague. From the Old Town Square you can admire the polychrome facades of the townhouses. On     your trip to Prague, take a few minutes to admire the mechanism of the astronomical clock. The St. Vitus Cathedral, the construction of which began     in 1344 and was completed in 1929 is another famous symbol of this city where time seems to have stopped.
The Charles Bridge, which has witnessed much of the history of Prague, connects the old town district with the Malá Stana (Little Quarter), a small     middle-class neighbourhood with a profusion of Baroque-influenced palaces and churches.
On your trip to Prague, take a step back in time and stroll through the oldest part of the city: the Jewish Quarter. Visit the Jewish Museum and the     Jewish cemetery, the resting place of some of the most illustrious characters in history, and you will discover the roots of Prague's Jewish culture.
A trip to Prague can sometimes feel Kafkaesque. All types of architecture - all genres - come together. Art Nouveau, Cubism and Renaissance form an     unlikely family. You can explore the delicate lines of the Municipal House, the Surrealist curves of the Caza Danzante or the Cubist forms of the House of     the Black Madonna.
This cultural diversity is not limited to architecture. Prague is a city of great taste. The city’s cafés and breweries are an invitation to sample the     famous Czech beers. And if the mood takes you, you can explore Prague’s nightlife in the up and coming suburbs of Vinohrady and Zizkov, a playground for     the city’s youth and avant-garde.
Romantic, mysterious or magical, whatever elements attract you, Prague is an enchanting city.

qz_1429,What is the final event in a decathlon?,1500 metres,"The decathlon is a combined event in ... One hour decathlon is a special type of decathlon, in which the athletes have to start the last of ten events ... The decathlon is a combined event in athletics consisting of ten track and field events. Events are held over two consecutive days and the winners are determined by the combined performance in all. Performance is judged on a points system in each event, not by the position achieved. The decathlon is contested mainly by male athletes, while female athletes typically compete in the heptathlon. Traditionally, the title of ""World's Greatest Athlete"" has been given to the man who wins the decathlon. This began when King Gustav V of Sweden told Jim Thorpe, ""You, sir, are the world's greatest athlete"" after Thorpe won the decathlon at the Stockholm Olympics in 1912. The current holder of the title is American Bryan Clay, the gold medal winner of the event at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, who took the title from Athens Olympics Czech champion Roman Šebrle. The event developed from the ancient pentathlon. Pentathlon competitions were held at the ancient Greek Olympics. Pentathlons involved five disciplines – long jump, discus throw, javelin throw, sprint and a wrestling match. Introduced in Olympia during 708 BC, the competition was extremely popular for many centuries. By the 6th century BC, pentathlons had become part of religious games. The Amateur Athletic Union held ""all around events"" from the 1880s and a decathlon first appeared on the Olympic athletics program at the 1904 Games. Format Men's decathlon The vast majority of international and top level men's decathlons are divided into a two-day competition, with the track and field events held in the order below. Traditionally, all decathletes who finished the event, rather than just the winner or medal winning athletes, do a round of honour together after the competition. Day 1 100 metres Long jump Shot put High jump 400 metres Day 2 110 metres hurdles Discus throw Pole vault Javelin throw 1500 metres Women's decathlon At major championships, the women's equivalent of the decathlon is the seven-event heptathlon; prior to 1981 it was the five-event pentathlon. However, in 2001, the IAAF approved scoring tables for women's decathlon; the current world record holder is Austra Skujytė of Lithuania. Women's disciplines differ from men's in the same way as for standalone events: the shot, discus and javelin weigh less, and the sprint hurdles uses lower hurdles over 100 m rather than 110 m. The points tables used are the same as for the heptathlon in the shared events. The schedule of events differs from the men's decathlon, with the field events switched between day one and day two; this is to avoid scheduling conflicts when men's and women's decathlon competitions take place simultaneously. Day 1 100 metres Discus throw Pole vault Javelin throw 400 metres Day 2 100 metres hurdles Long jump Shot put High jump 1500 metres One hour The one-hour decathlon is a special type of decathlon in which the athletes have to start the last of ten events (1500 m) within sixty minutes of the start of the first event. The world record holder is Czech decathlete Robert Změlík, who achieved 7,897 points at a meeting in Ostrava, Czechoslovakia, in 1992. Masters athletics In Masters athletics, performance scores are age graded before being applied to the standard scoring table. This way, marks that would be competitive within an age division can get rated, even if those marks would not appear on the scale designed for younger age groups. Additionally, like women, the age divisions use different implement weights and lower hurdles. Based on this system, German Rolf Geese in the M60 division and American Robert Hewitt in the M80 divisions have set their respective world records over 8,000 points. Using the same scale, Nadine O'Connor scored 10,234 points in the W65 division, the highest decathlon score ever recorded. Points system The 2001 IAAF points tables use the following formulae: Points = for track events (faster time produces a better score) Points = for field events (greater distance or height produces a better score) A, B and C are parameters that vary by discipline, as shown in the table on the right, while P is the performance by the athlete, measured in seconds (running), metres (throwing), or centimetres (jumping). The decathlon tables should not be confused with the scoring tables compiled by Bojidar Spiriev, to allow comparison of the relative quality of performances by athletes in different events. On those tables, for example, a decathlon score of 9,006 points equates to 1,265 ""comparison points"", the same number as a triple jump of 18 m. Benchmarks Split evenly between the events, the following table shows the benchmark levels needed to earn 1,000, 900, 800 and 700 points in each sport.

At the end of 2013, approximately 13.8 million people lived in Istanbul, making it the biggest city in Turkey. The urban population of Turkey The total population of Turkey is on its way to reaching 80 million inhabitants, which is about the same amouint as the population of Germany . Slightly more than half of the Turkish population live in urban areas , with Istanbul being home to the largest portion of this urban population with close to 14 million inhabitants. This is about 20 percent of the entire population. Istanbul is located at the entrance to the Black Sea, between Europe and Asia. It is attractive to both the people of Turkey as a place to live and work and foreign tourists who take advantage of its cultural and historic center. Due to its attractiveness and its location at the crossroads of the east and the west, the city has been investing in transportation infrastructure to support its strategic location and increasing growth. Ankara, the capital of Turkey, is the second largest city and home to about 4.5 million people. Izmir is the third largest, with almost 3 million inhabitants. A vast amount of the country’s population is located in these three metropolises. Economic growth in Turkey has decreased significantly since 2011 and increasing unemployment is a matter of concern, which may cause an increase in urban population due to people moving away from the rural areas in search of work. While joining the European Union has been a goal of Turkey for quite some time, tensions between Turkey and other nations are on the rise, as restrictions of freedom of expression and censorship by the government are also increasing. Show more… Istanbul Population 2016 - World Population Review World Population Review 14,557,000 Istanbul Population 2016 Istanbul is the largest city in Turkey and the heart of the country. It is also one of the largest agglomerations in Europe and the fifth largest city in the world in terms of population within city limits. Interestingly, Istanbul is a transcontinental city as it is located on the Bosphorus waterway in northwest Turkey between the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara. This means the commercial center is in Europe while the rest of the city is in Asia. In 2016, Istanbul has an estimated population of over 14.6 million. Istanbul has grown very rapidly over the past one hundred years, although it has always had a large population. Istanbul has remained one of the largest cities in the world for most of its long history. In fact, Istanbul (then Constantinople) had a population between 400,000 and 500,000 in 500 AD, pushing out Rome as the largest ever city in the world at the time. Istanbul has a very large area, which makes it one of the five most populous world cities, but its metropolitan area does not even rank in the top fifteen, as the metro area is nearly equivalent to the city proper. Istanbul has a population density of 2,523 people per square kilometer (6,530/sq mi), far greater than Turkey's density of 102 people per square kilometer. The most densely populated areas are the southwest, west and northwest of the city center as well as the European side, while the most densely populated district is the Asian side, Uskudar. Istanbul Demographics Istanbul has a very small foreign population of just 43,000 in 2007, but only 28% of the population originates from Istanbul. Istanbul is home to most of the ethnic and religious minorities in Turkey. The Kurdish community is the largest ethnic minority in the city, originating from southeastern and eastern Turkey, with a population of up to 3 million in Istanbul. This is the largest Kurdish population in the world.","The context explicitly states that Istanbul is the largest city in Turkey, with population figures from 2013 and 2016 confirming its status as the biggest city in the country. Multiple sources within the context, including the ""Turkey Facts on Largest Cities"" and ""Istanbul Population 2016"" sections, reinforce this information.",37,1,1,1,1,1

He follows the megastar round everywhere he goes to make sure things are running smoothly - although sometimes they aren't! Born in Leeds, Kevin travelled down from his hometown to meet Roland, impressed at the superstar's early TV appearances. Kevin was responsible for purchasing the Ratmobile, a 1953 Ford Anglia, which was sprayed pink. This was quite fortunate, as pink is Kevin's favourite colour! On Roland's first album, Kevin was responsible for recording three of the 10 tracks. He was even allowed to release one, Summer Holiday as a single! Of the other two tracks, one was called My Roland, a moving tribute to his best mate, and the other was a ditty about his favourite thing - a pink bucket. Kev likes nothing more than soaking his feet in his bucket at the end of a long day, so what better subject than that to write a song about?! He even persuaded Errol to do a rap on it! Kevin has appeared alongside Roland in every TV series he has made, from Rat On The Road, travelling to Switzerland, Hong Kong, Australia and Los Angeles. Kev is sometimes prone to panicking, and has fainted on many occasions, notably in a cable car in Switzerland when it got stuck halfway up a mountain! Kevin enjoys eating sunflower seeds, and prefers a glass of bitter lemon to champagne. He is sure to be alongside his best friend for a long time to come.

qz_1693,What name is given to the home of a beaver?,Lodge,"Beavers are famously busy, and they turn their talents to reengineering the landscape as few other animals can. When sites are available, beavers burrow in the banks of rivers and lakes. But they also transform less suitable habitats by building dams. Felling and gnawing trees with their strong teeth and powerful jaws, they create massive log, branch, and mud structures to block streams and turn fields and forests into the large ponds that beavers love. Domelike beaver homes, called lodges, are also constructed of branches and mud. They are often strategically located in the middle of ponds and can only be reached by underwater entrances. These dwellings are home to extended families of monogamous parents, young kits, and the yearlings born the previous spring.","The context explicitly mentions that beavers construct ""lodges"" as their homes, which are domelike structures made of branches and mud, strategically located in ponds with underwater entrances.

Bob Cratchit (Character)
Mickey's Christmas Carol (1983)
Cratchit :   Tomorrow is Christmas and I was wondering if I could have... Half a day off?
Scrooge :   Christmas, eh? Uh, er... I suppose so. But I'll dock you half a day's pay. Let's see, I pay you two shillings a day...
Cratchit :   Two shillings and a halfpenny, Sir.
Scrooge :   Oh yes, I gave you that raise three years ago.
Cratchit :   Yes, sir, when I started doing your laundry.
Fred :   Merry Christmas, Uncle Scrooge!
Scrooge :   What's so merry about it? I'll tell you what Christmas is. It's just another work day, and any jackanape who thinks else should be boiled in his own pudding!
Cratchit :   But sir, Christmas is a time for giving... a time to be with one's family.
Scrooge :   I say, Bah humbug!
Fred :   I don't care! I say, Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas!
Cratchit :  [clapping] Well said, Master Fred!
Scrooge :   Cratchit, what are you doing?
Cratchit :  [stops clapping] I was just trying to keep my hands warm, sir.
[Bob closes his book and starts to leave as the clock chimes 7:00. Scrooge looks at his watch]
Scrooge :   Hmm... Two minutes fast.
[Bob stops then goes back to his desk]
Scrooge :   Well, never mind those two minutes. You may go now.
Cratchit :   Ah, oh thank you, sir! You're so kind!
Scrooge :   Never mind that mushy stuff, just go! But be here all the other early the next day!
Cratchit :   I will, I will, sir! And a Bah Humbug... I mean, a Merry Christmas to you, sir!
Cratchit :   Oh, that Fred. Always so full of kindness.
Scrooge :   Aye. He always was a little peculiar
[door bell rings]
Cratchit :   Why, Mr. Scrooge, Merry Christmas.
[Scrooge barges in]
Cratchit :   Won't you come in?
Scrooge :   Merry Christmas? Humph! I have another bundle for you.
Cratchit :   But sir, it's Christmas Day.
Scrooge :   Christmas Day, indeed! Just another excuse for being lazy. And another thing, Cratchit: I've had enough of this 'half-day off' stuff! You leave me no alternative...
[changing his attitude]
Scrooge :   ...but to give you...
Tiny Tim :  [sees the contents of the now open bag] Toys!
Scrooge :   Yes, toys. No no no no no no no!
[lovingly]
Scrooge :   I'm giving you a raise... and making you my partner.

Bob Cratchit :   Good boy? And why not one in particular?
Tiny Tim :   Well... you said I can't have none of them, so I might as well like them all.
Ebenezer Scrooge :   And be good enough to leave me alone during business hours.
Nephew Fred :   Seven o'clock on Christmas Eve? That's not business hours, that's drudgery for the sake of it, and an insult to all men of goodwill.
Nephew Fred :  [surprised] Thank you, Bob Cratchit.
[Scrooge slowly turns on Cratchit]
Ebenezer Scrooge :   Another word from you, Cratchit, and you will celebrate Christmas by losing your position.

Bob Cratchit :   Yes. No. Er... Father Christmas?
[pulls down his mask briefly]
Mrs. Cratchit :   Mr. Scrooge? He's gone mad!
Bob Cratchit :   No, no, my dear, I'm sure there's an explanation.
Ebenezer Scrooge :   I want to see you in my office on Monday morning, when I will double your wages.

Record-Breakers and Trivia -  everyHit.com
Back To The 'Records & Trivia' Index
Most Number 1s
This, possibly the most important record, is held by Elvis Presley. He has had 21 chart-toppers, 18 of them different songs (three titles have topped the chart on two distinctly separate chart runs as part of the series of re-issues to commemorate what would have been Elvis' 70th birthday in 2005).  You can see how this record has 'changed hands' over the years here .
The Beatles are the top group with 17 number 1s.  Madonna is the top woman with 13 (as of April 2008).  Top female group is The Spice Girls with 9.
Only seven acts in chart history have got into double figures with their tally of chart-toppers. They are:  Elvis Presley (21, 18 different songs), The Beatles (17), Cliff Richard (14 : six of them with The Shadows, one with The Drifters, one with The Young Ones), Westlife (14 : one of them with Mariah Carey), Madonna (13), The Shadows (11 : six of them with Cliff Richard, two of these also with The Norrie Paramor Strings) and Take That (11: one featuring Lulu).
Westlife hold the record for getting into double-figures in the shortest time (2 years and 10 months [ie. 149 weeks] - more than 3 months quicker than The Beatles (who took 165 weeks). Unlike Westlife, however,  The Beatles tended to spend several weeks at the summit, slowing down their release rate.)
It is worth pointing out that Paul McCartney has appeared on more Number 1s than any other artist under a diverse range of credits. He has, in fact, appeared on 24 Number 1s; solo (1), with Wings (1), Stevie Wonder, The Christians et al (1), Ferry Aid (1), Band Aid (1), Band Aid 20 (1) and The Beatles (17).
In total, twenty-one artists have appeared on ten or more number one singles. They are:
Paul McCartney (24), Elvis Presley (21), John Lennon (20), George Harrison (18), Ringo Starr (16), Cliff Richard (15), Nicky Byrne, Kian Egan, Mark Feehily, Shane Filan (14), Robbie Williams, Madonna (13), Gary Barlow, Brian McFadden (12), Mel C , Geri Halliwell (11), Mel B, Emma Bunton, Howard Donald, Jason Orange, Mark Owen (10).
Artist with Most Weeks at Number 1
It's Elvis Presley. He has topped the chart for a total of 80 weeks (as of w/e 5th Feb 2005).
Top group is The Beatles (69 weeks). Top female performer is Madonna (29 weeks - as of w/e 17th May 2008).
In his many different manifestations, however, Paul McCartney has spent 93 weeks at the top.
Most Consecutive Number 1s
7 - by The Beatles and Westlife.
The Beatles' stretch began with ""A Hard Day's Night"" in 1964 and lasted to ""Yellow Submarine""/""Eleanor Rigby"" in 1966. The run was broken when ""Penny Lane""/""Strawberry Fields Forever"" merely made the number 2 position the following year!
Westlife's stint began with their debut, ""Swear it Again"" in 1999 and ran through to ""My Love"" in November 2000 (though one hit was a 'duet' with Mariah Carey). It was broken by ""What Makes A Man"" which peaked at number 2 the following month.
Beatles fans are, however, quick to point out that ""Ain't She Sweet"" (which made number 29 in 1964) was recorded in 1961, well before their EMI contract. It was issued by Polydor to 'cash in' on the success of the fab four. Fans argue that  this was not an ""official"" Beatles release. If this logic is accepted (though the track did make the charts), The Beatles run of successive number ones begins with ""From Me To You"" in April 1963 - making a total of 11.
Top female group is The Spice Girls (6 in a row from ""Wannabe"" through to ""Too Much"").
Longest Span of Number 1 Singles
47 years, 6 months and 23 days. Held by Elvis Presley. His first number 1 was ""All Shook Up"" in 1957 (w/e 13th June). His most recent chart-topper was the re-issue of ""It's Now Or Never"" in 2005 (w/e 5th Feb).
Runner up is Cliff Richard. His first chart-topper was ""Living Doll"" in 1959. His latest was ""The Millennium Prayer"" in 1999, a span of 40, 4 months and 15 days. (+ 21 days for total span).
Longest span for a female artist with solo credit is Madonna on 20 Years, 7 Months, 1 Day (from ""Into The Groove"", 3rd Aug 1985 to ""Sorry"", 4th March 2006 - ie. a total span of 1074 weeks).

The Kray twins - jailed in 1969.
Reginald and Ronald Kray were notorious criminals whose  obsession with assaulting others, encouraging each other to greater levels of  violence, and extending their personal power and domination culminated in a  serious protection racket in London and a number of murders. Their blatant  violence and unstable mental condition, particularly of Ronald Kray, led to  intimidation of witnesses and the prospect of their escaping justice until they  were arrested and convicted by the efforts of a special squad of detectives led  by Detective Superintendent Leonard (""Nipper"") Read.
The twins were born in 1933 and made their first appearance  at the Old Bailey in 1950, where the case of assault was dismissed for lack of  evidence. In 1952 they entered a period of National Service remarkable for their  violence, serious trouble with the military authorities and periods in custody.  After being released, they commenced a period of increasing control over  criminals, pubs and clubs in the East End of London. On 5th November  1956 Ronald Kray was jailed for 3 years for assaulting Terence Martin in a  gang-related incident, later became friends in Wandsworth prison with Frank  Mitchell and was diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. His  violence worsened after his release.
In February 1960 Reginald Kray was imprisoned for 18 months  for protection-related threats, and whilst he was in prison, Peter Rachman, the  head of a violent landlord operation, gave Ronald the Esmeralda's Barn night  club in Knightsbridge which served to increase the twins' influence in the West  End, and with some ""celebrities"" and famous people, rather than East End  criminals. They were assisted by a banker Alan Cooper who needed protection from  the rival Richardson gang from South London.
Christmas 1965 marked a confrontation between the Krays and  Richardsons at the Astor Club when a Richardson henchman, George Cornell,  referred to Ronald Kray as a ""fat poof"". A gang war followed, and a Kray ally  Richard Hart was murdered at Mr Smith's club in Catford on 8th March  1966. Ronald Kray took revenge by killing George Cornell in The Blind Beggar  public house, Whitechapel Road. Intimidation prevented any witnesses from  cooperating with police.
On 12th December 1966 the Krays assisted Frank  Mitchell (""The Mad Axeman"") to escape from Dartmoor prison, but Mitchell became  increasingly violent and unstable whilst staying in a flat in Barking Road. He  disappeared and the Kray twins were later acquitted of his murder, allegedly on  23 December 1966 in London E6. The body was  never recovered.
Ronald gave a gun and ï¿½100 to Jack ""The Hat"" McVitie with  instructions to murder Leslie Payne and the promise of a further ï¿½400 when the  murder had taken place. Payne remained alive, but it was Reginald who went to  collect the ï¿½100. He was moved by McVitie's tale of sorrow and gave McVitie ï¿½50.  This infuriated Ronald, and led to a stand-off between the Krays and McVitie,  culminating in the Krays inviting him to a ""party"" where Reginald, egged on by  Ronald, murdered him. McVitie's was another body not recovered.
[...]","The context explicitly states that George Cornell was shot and killed by Ronnie Kray at the Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel, East London, in 1966. This is corroborated by multiple references in the provided context, including mentions of the pub's name in relation to the murder.",38,1,1,1,1,1
qz_1872,Who composed the musical theme for the Pink Panther?,Henry Mancini,"""The Pink Panther Theme"" was written by Henry Mancini as the opening title music to the film comedy of the same name, which starred Peter Sellers as the bumbling Inspector Clouseau. The song evolved from a single cartoon cell conceived of the feline character featured in the opening credits, and Mancini only provided a tempo to the animators, rather than a complete score as was usual in the business. The accents of the brass section and the now-famous ""dead ant"" cadence had an immediate appeal to moviegoers, while jazz musician Plas Johnson was specifically recruited by Mancini for the now-legendary tenor sax solo. Mancini quickly realized that the music was also perfect for the jewel thief's character in the film (played by David Niven ), so the opening music became the recurring theme throughout the movie. Mancini 's recording is easily the most widely known, though a jazz treatment recorded by alto sax great Phil Woods with trumpeter Carl Saunders merits attention as well.","The context explicitly states that Henry Mancini composed the musical theme for the Pink Panther, as it mentions he wrote the theme for the film and provided the tempo for the animators.

Animals > Bats > All About Bats BATS Often mistaken for birds and as with most mysterious creatures, associated with a lot of misconceptions, superstition and of course, evil, bats are ordinary mammals made extraordinary by being the only mammal capable of true flight. Bats, also known as flying foxes, belong to the Chiroptera order, the second largest group of mammals. Around 1100 species bats have been reported worldwide and since they prefer warm climate, they don’t normally make their homes north or south of the sub-tropics. First, let’s deal with the myths…bats are not bad…although we just called them Bad Airborne Tropical Species. They are just one of Nature’s best creations yet. Amazing, mysterious and in so many ways the most efficient survivor in the world’s ecosystems. Their teeth are not different from that of a cat…or a dog, or our own…best suited to their diet. You might wonder why they have such sharp teeth when they eat on fruit…but ask yourself this…were you able to eat an apple by yourself when you were 2 years old? No…because your jaws did not have the strength to crush the apple to chew on them. Instead if you had sharp teeth, you would easily be able to take a bite even if you were as small as a bat. Thirdly, bats being associated with the devil and all that is nothing but rubbish…they are just one of the most beautiful and intriguing and by and far, the most misunderstood animals that belong to planet Earth. So what are bats? Mammals or Birds Good question…and a question that every single child and adult would ask if they have not attended, or paid attention in high school. Well, they fly, so they should be birds…but they give birth to their young and suckle them with their mammary glands…so they should be mammals right? True. But there are other mammals like the Duck Billed Platypus which lay eggs – Oviparous Mammals. So how do we really classify bats as mammals? Mammals are identified not merely by the presence of mammary glands or by being Viviparous or animals that give birth to their offspring. They are identified by External Ears or Pinnae. If you notice, Fishes or Pisces, have the Lateral Line Sense Organ that senses vibration in the water. Amphibians have the Tympanic membrane that senses sound. Reptiles, either have the tympanic membrane or like snakes , completely do away with hearing and focus on ground vibrations. In birds or Aves, the tympanic membrane is located in a recess with a tube that connects it to the surface of their body. However, Mammals and all of them have pronounced external ears called Pinnae Hair on the body: Yes, Bats have hair and it is nothing like the furry legs of the tarantula or any other non-mammalian species that may have hair on their legs. This is a typical characteristic of all mammals, which distinguishes the Bat from its avian counterparts The presence of mammary glands: All mammals have a specially modified set of sweat glands called mammary glands that in the females, produce milk that the offspring nurse on before they are weaned to their normal diet. Bats being mammals have these glands and they suckle their young ones as humans and other mammals do.","The context explicitly mentions that ""Types of Bats"" include ""Fruit,"" ""Cricket,"" and ""Horseshoe,"" indicating that these are all varieties of bats.",38,1,1,1,1,1

The Nobel Prize in Physics 1921 was awarded to Albert Einstein ""for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect"".
Albert Einstein received his Nobel Prize one year later, in 1922. During the selection process in 1921, the Nobel Committee for Physics decided that none of the year's nominations met the criteria as outlined in the will of Alfred Nobel. According to the Nobel Foundation's statutes, the Nobel Prize can in such a case be reserved until the following year, and this statute was then applied. Albert Einstein therefore received his Nobel Prize for 1921 one year later, in 1922.

The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from the surface of matter
(usually metals) when light shines on it. Einstein explained the effect by proposing that light consists of small particles, or quanta, called photons, which carry energy that is proportional to the frequency of light. The electrons in the matter that absorb the energy of the photon get ejected. He published these findings in 1905 in the paper ""On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light."" Einstein's observations that the photoelectric effect could be explained only if light behaves like a particle, not a wave, was instrumental in establishing the hypothesis that light can behave both like a wave and a particle.
The photoelectric effect is the basis for photosynthesis. It also forms the basis for a variety of devices such as photodiodes, which are used in light detection within fiber optics, telecommunications networks, solar cells, imaging, and many other applications.
An interesting note: Records show the Nobel Prize Awarding Institution, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, decided to reserve the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, and therefore awarded no Physics prize that year. According to the statutes, a reserved prize can be awarded the year after, and Albert Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize for 1921 one year later, in 1922.
Einstein was unable to attend the December 10 Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm. He presented his Nobel speech on July 11, 1923, in Gothenburg.
Einstein died on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, NJ.

Dog Owner's Guide: Canine feet
Different paws for different dogs
Introduction
It's pretty obvious that a dog is a quadruped, a sure-footed, four-footed critter with specialized paws that help him get around the block, across the field, and off the sofa. What is not so obvious is just how special those paws really are.
First, a bit of anatomy is in order. A dog walks on his toes like a horse, not the soles of his feet like a bear or a human. The dog's front limb assembly resembles the human arm with shoulder, upper arm, and forearm, but there the direct correlation ends. The human wrist is analogous to the canine pastern joint, the back of the hand is the dog's pastern, and the fingers form the dog's paws.
In back, again the upper part of the dog's body parallels the human leg structure with upper thigh joined to hip at one end and knee at the other and lower thigh leading from knee to heel. The dog's heel doesn't touch the ground, however; it is represented by the hock joint and the human foot becomes the dog's rear pastern, and the human toes are his rear paws.
The dog's paws provide both traction and shock absorption and come in handy for digging. Thick pads absorb more shock and increase endurance. Rough pads allow for better traction for quick turns and effective sprinting.
Each foot has four pads on the ground, each with its own toenail. Some breeds also have dew claws, a fifth toe on the inside of the paw that doesn't touch the ground. Dew claws are generally left on the front feet, but usually removed on the hind feet as they can catch on obstacles and tear. Dew claws are removed when the pup is a few days old, before his nerves are completely active so he feels no pain.
Toenails
Dog toenails grow as do human fingernails and toenails. The nails should be kept in good trim to avoid scratching when the dog paws at a bare human leg and to keep the dog's structure as sound as possible. Long nails can cause the dog to rock back on his paws, causing strain on his leg assemblies and interfering with his gait.
Sometimes, dog nails grind down if the dog exercises on concrete. Otherwise, the nails should be trimmed regularly. Nail trimmers are available at pet supply stores for the job.
Dog nails have a blood supply or quick but the end of the nails are dead tissue and can be clipped without pain. The trick is to trim as close to the quick as possible without actually cutting it and causing it to bleed. The quick appears as a dark line in white nails but is almost impossible to see in darn nails. The best way to begin trimming is to clip only the sharp, curved portion of the nail and then work back a bit towards the paw. Clip only a small bit at a time to avoid trouble.
The easiest way is to accustom puppies to having their feet handled daily so they'll sit still for this essential part of good grooming. Adult dogs may be more difficult, especially if they hate having their feet handled or have been quicked at some time.
Owners who are willing and able to trim Stranger's nails can get a demonstration of technique from their veterinarian at the puppy check-up visits. Squeamish owners can, of course, make an appointment with the groomer to have Fido's nails clipped.
Different paws for different dogs
Although all dog paws are basically the same, some are shaped slightly differently than others. Many breed standards specify ""cat feet,"" which are the result of short third digital bones. These compact feet require less energy to lift, allowing the dog to conserve energy and increase his endurance in the field. Akita, Doberman Pinscher, Giant Schnauzer, Kuvasz, Newfoundland, Airedale Terrier, Bull Terrier, Keeshond, Finnish Spitz, and Old English Sheepdog are among the breeds with catlike, compact feet.
Hare feet are elongated with the two center toes longer than the side toes. Breeds with hare feet include several of the toy breeds, Samoyed, Bedlington Terrier, Skye Terrier, Borzoi, and Greyhound.
Breeds that work in water tend to have webbed feet. Newfoundland, Chesapeake Bay Retriever, Portuguese Water  Dog, Field Spaniel, and German Wirehaired Pointer are among the breeds with webbed feet.

Anna Nicole Smith: Supreme Court rules Anna Nicole Smith daughter not entitled to estate - latimes
Supreme Court rejects Anna Nicole Smith case
Justices say her heir is not entitled to a share of her tycoon husband's estate.
June 24, 2011 |By David G. Savage, Washington Bureau
Former Playboy playmate Anna Nicole Smith married billionaire oil tycoon… (Splash News, Splash News )
Reporting from Washington — Former Playboy playmate Anna Nicole Smith's heir is not entitled to share in the $1.6-billion estate of her elderly Texas husband, the Supreme Court ruled, apparently ending a Dickensian legal struggle.
Because the battle over oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall II's wealth outlived most of the parties to the suits, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. compared it to ""Bleak House,"" Charles Dickens' novel about a lawsuit that never ends.
Vickie Lynn Marshall, who was better known as Anna Nicole Smith, married the 89-year-old billionaire a year before his death in 1995. Although he had given her many gifts and apparently promised many more, she was not included in his will.
She sued in Texas probate court, alleging that Marshall's son Pierce, a prime heir, had conspired to deny her as much as $400 million that her late husband had promised. That case went to trial, and she lost.
She filed separately for bankruptcy in Los Angeles. Pierce Marshall filed a claim against her in California bankruptcy court, accusing her of defaming him. She filed a counter-claim asserting that Pierce Marshall had schemed to deny her the money his father had promised, and won big. In 2000, the bankruptcy judge awarded her $475 million in damages, essentially the amount she had sought from the estate.
Since then, the case has been in the hands of appellate judges, seeking a ruling on which court had the authority to decide the matter: the state probate court in Texas or the federal bankruptcy court in California.
The case made several trips to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco as well as two trips to the Supreme Court.
Along the way, the damages were reduced to $88 million.
But the dispute came to an end Thursday. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled the bankruptcy judge had overplayed his hand and should not have awarded damages against Pierce Marshall. Roberts said the bankruptcy judge had the authority to resolve Smith's debts, but not to decide her claims against Marshall.
Eric Brunstad, a lawyer for the Marshall family, said the decision ""finally puts to rest years and years of litigation, and vindicates Pierce, who passed away five years ago this week.""
Smith died in 2007. Howard K. Stern, her former domestic partner, had carried on the case as executor of her estate. Her sole beneficiary is her daughter, Dannielynn Birkhead, who will be 5 in September. Smith's adult son, Daniel, died in 2006, days after Dannielynn's birth.
The case of Stern vs. Marshall may well live on in bankruptcy circles, since Roberts wrote a major opinion on the constitutional limits on bankruptcy judges.
Los Angeles lawyer Kent Richland, who argued the case for Stern, called the implications ""quite significant.""
Usually, bankruptcy judges seek to resolve all of the complicated side disputes involving a bankrupt person or company, but the chief justice said their authority did not extend to disputes under state law that could be handled in state court.

Sept 8 (Reuters) - Factbox on striker Wayne Rooney who set an all-time England scoring record of 50 goals in a Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland at Wembley Stadium on Tuesday. Born: Oct. 24, 1985 in Liverpool. CLUB CAREER: After coming through Everton 's youth academy, Rooney made his first-team debut as a 16-year-old against Tottenham Hotspur in August 2002. He scored his first Premier League goal for Everton on Oct.19 with a last minute match-winner against Arsenal, five days before his 17th birthday. Manchester United signed the 18-year-old for 25.6 million pounds ($39.42 million) in August 2004. He made his United debut on Sept.28 scoring a hat-trick in a 6-2 home win over Fenerbahce in the Champions League to become the youngest player to score a hat-trick in the competition, aged 18 years 335 days. Rooney has won five Premier League titles, two League Cups and one Champions League with United. He was England's Footballer of the Year in 2010. Rooney was handed a five-year contract by David Moyes in February 2014 and given the captain's armband after Louis van Gaal took charge at Old Trafford ahead of the 2014-15 season. Rooney is third on United's record all-time scoring list with 233 goals in 485 appearances. He is 16 behind Bobby Charlton's record of 249. ENGLAND: Made his debut aged 17 years 111 days on Feb.12 2003, coming on as a halftime substitute in a 3-1 defeat to Australia at Upton Park to become England's then-youngest ever player, breaking a record that had stood since 1879. Scored his first senior international goal in his sixth international on Sept.6 2003 against Macedonia in Skopje in England's 2-1 Euro 2004 qualifying win to become the country's youngest scorer at 17 years 317 days. Rooney scored four times in the Euro 2004 finals before England bowed out in the quarter-finals to Portugal. Almost missed the 2006 World Cup finals after suffering a foot injury two months before the tournament. Despite recovering in time, Rooney looked far from his best and failed to score against Trinidad & Tobago and Sweden before his tournament ended in misery after being sent off in the quarter-final defeat by Portugal. LACKLUSTRE PERFORMANCES: After England failed to qualify for Euro 2008, Rooney had to wait until the 2010 World Cup in South Africa to play in another major international tournament. However, the striker's lacklustre, goalless performances were criticised and England were eliminated in the second round. Rooney helped England secure their place at Euro 2012 but was sent off in their last qualifier against Montenegro and was banned for three matches, which was reduced to two on appeal. Missed England's opening two games of Euro 2012 against France and Sweden but scored on his return against Ukraine before England were knocked out on penalties in the quarter-finals by Italy. BECOMING CAPTAIN: Having endured two disappointing World Cup campaigns, Rooney was determined to make amends at last year's tournament in Brazil but he was played out of position in England's opening match against Italy. Rooney did score his first ever World Cup goal in England's 2-1 defeat by Uruguay before they were knocked out of the tournament without a win in the group stage. After England's poor World Cup showing, Steven Gerrard retired from international duty and relinquished the captaincy. Coach Roy Hodgson named Rooney as captain in August ahead of the start of England's Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. Rooney scores his 50th goal for England in 107 appearances with a penalty against Switzerland in a Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley and has overtaken Bobby Charlton's record of 49.

Football in Ecuador and other sporting activities
When it comes to local sports, the most popular activity is generally soccer (football). Tourists are often welcome to join in on local games, but remember that many of the locals play the game often and display quite impressive skill. Soccer in Ecuador is something of a national pastime and local soccer heroes are celebrated with enthusiasm. In fact, the national soccer team has made waves all over the world, with Ecuador displaying some outstanding soccer talent that perhaps some parts of the world were completely unprepared to receive. In Ecuador, soccer is so popular that it is considered to be the national sport. Sometimes you will find locals playing more unusual games such as the “paddleball” which is played in Ibarra. These two, can be joined in on, but it is a good idea to watch for a while first and learn the rules of the game. Many of the locals along the coast also enjoy a good game of volleyball.
Ecuador certainly has a wealth of sporting activities to partake in. Many of them require the hire of equipment or of a knowledgeable guide. You may also need someone to show you how to partake of the sport. You can be sure though, that any effort or expense is well worth it and that you will enjoy every moment of the activity you choose as it will be provided in a safe, well organized manner.
The most accessible activities are generally those that require very little equipment. Things such as walking, hiking and climbing – which is basically walking up to the peak of a mountain – are available just about everywhere in Ecuador. Of course, some of the more complex trails might require the services of a guide, but otherwise all you need is good health, a comfortable pair of shoes and a map. Sometimes tour operators will offer climbing tours wherein they will provide equipment, insurance, food and transport – basically all the facilities you will need to enjoy your climb in relative luxury. Most climbs take place up the sides of volcanoes to get you better acquainted with this natural phenomenon. Rainforest treks where you explore the fauna and flora of the Amazon basin are also popular.
Mountain bikes are readily available for hire throughout the country and often tourists will choose to bike between towns as this is an excellent way to really experience Ecuador. Water activities include swimming, whitewater rafting, snorkeling, kayaking, fishing, surfing, windsurfing and scuba diving – depending on what part of the country you are visiting. On the more extreme side of things, Bungee jumping, hang-gliding and Paragliding are also offered. Horseback riding and volleyball are two more popular choices. Mules and jeeps are available for hire as are yachts and rowing boats.
The Galapagos Islands themselves have a wealth of interesting activities to pursue, such as hiking, sea kayaking, snorkeling and scuba diving . The Galapagos Islands are part of a well protected nature reserve so it is best to remember to try not disturb any of the natural environment when visiting here. It is also a good idea to bring a camera or two – one for land and one for under water. There is such an abundance of wildlife here that you will not regret it.
If you are intent on pursuing any of these activities specifically, it would be prudent to ensure that they are being offered at your destination of the choice. Certainly one can see that there is a wealth of things to do in Ecuador and that if you so desire, your holiday can be as action packed as you want.

Battle to save historic rail line that heralded the age of science
As a high court hearing looms, a leading historian joins the outcry over a plan to demolish parts of the world’s first intercity railway in Manchester

It is the crucible of the modern age, the hallowed birthplace of the industrial era in Britain and around the world. Yet the survival of much of a historic railway site, hailed by heritage experts as “the Stonehenge of railway history” – a miraculous survivor from the dawn of steam-driven transport – hangs on the outcome of an extraordinary high court hearing.
The increasingly bitter fight over the Ordsall Chord, a curving, 340-metre, £85m rail link between Victoria and Piccadilly stations in Manchester, focuses on the fate of the extensive, and exceptionally intact, remains of the world’s first intercity railway – the near-complete viaducts, track, arches, bridges, warehouses and end-of-line terminus of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.
Time capsules in brick and iron, overlooked by the inner-Manchester sprawl, the surviving structures were designed and built in the late 1820s and 1830s. They are listed grade I and grade II* – the highest levels of statutory protection – yet under a redevelopment scheme, chosen by Network Rail and vigorously supported by Manchester city council, large portions of the site will be destroyed, or remodelled beyond recognition, as the new Ordsall Chord line is driven through. Thirteen listed structures and buildings would be harmed.

The Ordsall Chord railway link proposed by Network Rail.
Network Rail decided against an alternative scheme, proposed by one of its own consultant civil engineers, which would have provided the new rail link without damaging the historic site. Under the scheme chosen, the mainline track serving Liverpool Road station, the world’s oldest passenger terminus, will be permanently severed – cutting it off, for the first time since its opening 185 years ago, to rail travellers outside Manchester.
Network Rail is pressing ahead with the scheme, despite strong opposition from English Heritage and campaigners. Now one of Britain’s most eminent historians, Sir Neil Cossons, has joined the fray with an attack on the “arrogance” of Network Rail and the council, which he sees as symptomatic of profit-margin philistinism. “In Network Rail you’ve got a major engineering enterprise, a multibillion pound national organisation, with no board-level expertise in design and heritage,” he told the Observer. “Its troubles are ones of taking a sledge hammer to crack a nut.”
On the afternoon of 15 September 1830, the very first intercity passenger train arrived at Liverpool Road station having set out on the 35-mile journey from Liverpool at 11am. VIPs packed into the 300ft-long train – open to the elements, and coasting along at between 10 and 24mph – included the prime minister the Duke of Wellington, MPs, ambassadors and dignitaries.
The arrival of the train is symbolic of the start of the age of science and its commercial exploitation that made Britain the world’s pre-eminent power. The station is now home to the Museum of Science and Industry. It has become a mecca for steam enthusiasts, with historic trains from across Britain running to and from the station.
The museum had strongly opposed the scheme in view of the damage it would cause to the historic structures near the station. However, following negotiations with Network Rail last year, the museum withdrew its opposition and has been offered a £3m contribution that it intends to use to enhance and expand visitor attractions.

qz_2404,What is the scientific name given to tea?,Camellia Sinensis,"Tea's Scientific Name—The Basics
It's not uncommon for the common names of plants to vary from place to place and time period to time period.  This also holds true for tea plants (see Common Names:  What's in a Name? ).  A scientific name, on the other hand, is the same around the world.  So while North Americans call it tea and Russians call it chai, it Camellia sinensis in both places and everywhere in between.
Scientific names are important because they provide the means for growers and those in the scientific community to accurately reference and discuss the same plant.  Even if you're not a scientist, the one way to ensure you're getting the exact plant you want at your local nursery is to use its scientific name. 
Yes, scientific names are Latin.  Yes, they're standardized.  But don't let either of those things intimidate you.   If you know a few basics, they're also fun as you can start to puzzle out details of the plants they're naming.  Don't forget that English is full of words with Latin origins, so it's often logical to work out meanings.  The following is a very brief overview of scientific names as they relate to tea.  
Early Scientific Names for Tea
The first scientific mention of tea in the West came in 1712 when it was called Thea.  Thea came from t'e, the word used for tea in the Amoy dialect.  Then in 1753 Carl von Linné of Sweden (more commonly known as Linnaeus) included tea in his groundbreaking work, Species Plantarum.  Although he described tea plants in its pages, the work is best known for the simple and effective formula for naming plants that Linnaeus introduced in it to replace an extraordinarily cumbersome system.  In fact, the system he introduced is the one we still use today.
With his binomial (two names) system, every plant is assigned two latinized names that together uniquely identify it: a genus and a specific epithet that together comprise the species name.  For tea, Camellia is the plant's genus name, sinensis is its specific epithet, and the species is Camellia sinensis.  Explanations follow.","The context explicitly states that the scientific name for tea is Camellia sinensis, introduced by Linnaeus and standardized as the binomial name. The answer is directly derived from this information.",33,1,1,1,1,1

It took an ad campaign to sell Americans on its value

Mr. ZIP, a cartoon mail character created in the early 1960s to entice Americans to use ZIP codes.
Follow @TIME
1963 was a momentous year in America: President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech at the March on Washington and, somewhat less heralded by all but the most fervent postal historians, the ZIP code was introduced.
Since its founding in 1775, the post office relied on hand sorting based on local addresses to get mail where it was supposed to go. A piece of mail often went through 10 postal workers before making it to its recipient. But by the 1940s, the then-named Post Office Department realized its sorting system was not keeping pace with the growing population of the country it served.
In 1943, as a way to streamline mail sorting for the biggest American cities, the post office began placing one and two digit numbers between the city and the state to help clerks wade through the increasing volume of mail, which was then around 20 million pieces per year.
(MORE:  How to Fix the Post Office: Keep the ‘Last Mile,’ Outsource the Rest )
By the early 1960s, the post-war population boom and continued western growth led to even greater use of the postal service. Mail volume doubled between 1943 and 1962, putting further pressure on the post office to sort mail efficiently. On July 1, 1963, on the recommendation of an internal advisory board, the post office introduced the Zone Improvement Plan Code, which divided the entire country into coded delivery areas. The first two or three numbers told carriers to which states mail was being sent. More populous regions like New York were given five digit numbers starting with 10-14, for example, whereas less populous areas like Montana received five-digit numbers. These new ZIP codes helped the post office better pinpoint where mail was headed while allowing it to expand machine-based sorting systems that could quickly read digits. But many Americans were reluctant to adopt the new system.
“People were concerned they were being turned into numbers,” says Jennifer Lynch, a U.S. Postal Service historian. “They thought it was depersonalizing them.”
To get people on board, the post office began an extensive marketing campaign centered around Mr. ZIP, a friendly looking cartoon mail carrier. A folk group called The Swingin’ Six sang about ZIP Code usage in a lengthy public service announcement video. “Put ZIP in your mail” ran in magazines across the country, including TIME, while a series of short TV ads showed postal workers drowning in a sea of letters and used slogans like “Only you can put ZIP in your postal system.”
Evidently the ads were persuasive. In 1966, three years after ZIP Codes were introduced, 50% of Americans said they used ZIP Codes. By 1969, 83% said they did, according to a 1969 study conducted by Roper Research Associates.
In 1983, the post office expanded the ZIP Code to nine digits to identify which side of the street the mail was being delivered to, as well as particular office buildings. Today, ZIP codes are translated into “automation-readable barcodes” that are placed on pieces of mail when sorted and contain 31 digits of information that tell the post office everything from whether it was presorted, if the mail is first-class or a periodical, and even which business sent it. It also allows the U.S.P.S. to track virtually every letter and package around the country.
(MORE: U.S. Postal Service to Launch Clothing Line )
The post office estimates that increased efficiencies for both large mailers and the postal service itself add almost $10 billion of value to the U.S. economy a year.
Today, 50 years after the ZIP code debuted, the postal service’s Office of the Inspector General is recommending that they be linked to digital geographic information systems based on latitude and longitude to further increase delivery accuracy. This time, however, Mr. ZIP will stay in retirement.","The context explicitly states that the ZIP code was introduced in 1963, which falls within the 1960s decade. Additionally, it mentions that in 1966, three years after introduction, 50% of Americans used ZIP codes, confirming the introduction occurred in the 1960s.",36,1,1,1,1,1

What's not to like? 15 December 2004 Forget today's sex symbols...Marilyn is IT. If Kate Moss moved into the flat above mine while my wife was out of town with the kids, I'd have no trouble resisting temptation; but, Marilyn Monroe is a force of nature. She's a fertility goddess. She is pure hourglass with a dynamite smile. In short, she is pure concentrated femininity. This movie is a comedy, and a good one at that. The timing of Monroe and Ewell is flawless. The scene where he jumps Marilyn on the piano bench in a brief moment of passion causing them both to fall to the floor gives this brief exchange... ""I'm sorry"", Ewell says, ""This has never happened to me before"" Marilyn answers, while standing up and adjust her clothes, ""That's funny. It happens to me all the time""... Priceless...

They soon get to know each other and become friends over champagne, potato chips, and a Rachmaninoff record. Their friendship causes Mr. Sherman to worry that his wife will find out about his relationship with the blonde bombshell. With his overactive imagination, Mr. Sherman dreams up numerous situations concerning this young woman, as well as his wife. Although his imagination causes Mr. Sherman much worry, it provides many of the film's most memorable and enjoyable scenes. Of course, the film is famous for the scene of Monroe standing over the subway grate, which has always been a classic movie scene. Monroe, although unnamed in the film, gives one of her best screen performances, which is ""just elegant,"" as she says throughout the movie. She displays a talent for comedy as well as beauty, which should not be overlooked. Ewell's portrayal of Richard Sherman is delightful, hilarious, and perfect. His facial expressions and comedic timing contribute to the film's enjoyability. Along with these stars, the supporting cast is excellent as well. It includes such character actors as Robert Strauss (Mr. Kruhulik, the janitor), and Donald MacBride (Mr. Brady, Richard Sherman's boss). ""The Seven Year Itch"" is one of the ultimate 50's pop culture films. And since it was filmed in Cinemascope, it would be perfect to see on the big screen. Any fan of Monroe, Wilder, old movies, or 50's culture would enjoy this movie; I strongly recommend it. The comedy, timing, acting, and direction are flawless...and they all help to make ""The Seven Year Itch"" ""just elegant!""

Big Brother, the surreal centrepiece of this week's events, turned its overwhelmed winner, comedian Jack Dee, into a national sweetheart. Red Nose Day has become an institution, with this year's slogan of ""Say pants to Poverty"" adding another twist to the already bizarre spectacle of 4m plastic noses adorning British faces and cars yesterday in aid of the charity. During the Big Brother contestants' painfully public incarceration in a house full of cameras, Dee made several foiled escape attempts, managing to break free just long enough to give his wife Jane a hug. Last night, allowed to leave the house legitimately after being voted the winner by the viewing public, deadpan Dee finally showed emotion when he was greeted outside by Jane, hugging her tightly and planting a kiss on her lips. Earlier Keith Duffy, a member of the boy band Boyzone and one of the most jovial members of the house, left after being voted out. He embraced fellow housemates Claire Sweeney, the Brookside actress, and Dee before leaving to a rapturous reception from fans gathered in the rain outside. He shouted: ""I need a good drink."" The show has so far raised £500,000 for charity. The houses's first evictee, former boxer Chris Eubank, had been swiftly followed by a crestfallen Feltz, Anthea Turner, then Duffy and finally runner-up Sweeney. Despite sour grapes from ""nasty"" Nick Bateman, Big Brother's original celebrity, who dismissed the latest contestants as ""a bunch of desperate celebrities trying to advance dwindling careers"", the programme raised millions as the public phoned to vote for the latest evictees. Elsewhere, more than 150,000 fundraising events led up to yesterday's BBC television extravaganza, which also featured a long-awaited interview between Ali G and the Beckhams. Robbie Williams's personal belongings were auctioned and Billy Connolly performed one of his habitual streaks, this time around Eros in Piccadilly. It was only to be screened last night if television audiences raised £1m in an hour. A special edition of Harry Potter books looks set to raise up to £20m from worldwide sales. A total of £174m has been raised since Red Nose Day's inception in 1985. Then it was launched from a refugee camp in Sudan in 1985 as an attempt to relieve poverty in Africa. But more than a quarter of this year's money has come from commercial donors, turning Red Nose into a brand in its own right and posing questions about the spirit of the campaign. Earlier in the week BT was criticised for taking a hefty portion of money from people calling its Comic Relief premium rate line.

Celebrity Big Brother , the star-packed successor to the slice-of-life international TV hit is under way on Channel 4 . 2. The new manifestation of the show aims to raise money for Comic Relief and features six British celebrities who are scrapping it out over a week to be the last survivor by this Friday's Red Nose Day . 3. Boxer Chris Eubank, Brookside actress Claire Sweeney, Boyzone star Keith Duffy, comedian Jack Dee, and TV presenters Anthea Turner and Vanessa Feltz entered the house last Friday to live under the gaze of its 24 cameras. 4. The first evictee has already been chosen with Chris Eubank being given his marching orders in the viewers' poll on Saturday night, attracting more than 750,000 votes, with each telephone call raising 15.5p for the charity. 5. Anthea Turner was nominated alongside Eubank (the contestants secretly nominate each other and the two with the most nominations face a public poll) but escaped, with some help from her husband Grant Bovey , who has admitted running up a huge phone bill to help keep her in. 6. Eubank dished the dirt on Anthea afterwards, claiming she was ""fragile"" and upset by her negative public image. This was increased by mocking tabloid coverage of her wedding, which featured a tie-up deal with a glossy magazine and a chocolate manufacturer. 7. Meanwhile, Jack Dee has indicated he is less than enthralled at living in the UK's least private house and on Sunday tested out the night-vision cameras. As Sweeney and Duffy relaxed in the infamous hot tub, Dee was in the garden secretly digging a hole under a fence . He then spied an open gate but was quickly captured by security guards and frog-marched back. 8. Commentators have pointed out that the celebrities have been afforded more privacy in the reality TV show than their predecessors, and are living without the intrusion of 24-hour web cam coverage; instead, there are edited video clips available to internet viewers. 9. The nation was enthralled last year as 10 strangers, who started out as unknowns, lived together in the Big Brother house for nine weeks with one being evicted every week in an attempt to win the £70,000 prize money. 10. Craig Phillips won the cash and donated it to a young friend for vital surgery, but only after a blistering confrontation with 'Nasty' Nick Bateman , who had taken a very Machiavellian approach to winning at all costs . search_results.search_context[4]: | Comic Relief Red Nose Day 2001 Say Pants to Poverty Comic Relief raised a thwacking £61m in 2001.

Underground History - Walford East Station Set
As fans of the popular British television show are aware (or perhaps unaware?), this of course is a fictitious station, which is not found on any Underground map past or present.  The station was created on the back-lot of BBC Elstree studios and is now a permanent fixture, with its mock Leslie Green facia.
The fictitious station is located on the District line. The map on the wall was printed with actual train times to and from Walford East - though closer inspection of the map showed that Walford East was located between Bow Road and West Ham (thus taking the place of Bromley-by-Bow).   The trains that can be occasionally seen passing on the line are in reality motorised not by electricity, but are in fact pushed along by stagehands!  More recently, passing trains have been digitally added.
Inside, the station is equipped with ticket vending machines and other paraphernalia that you'd usually expect to see inside an Underground station, all provided by London Underground to provide an authentic look and feel. Even the timetable outside the station is especially made, showing times from Walford East to nearby stations! When not used, the station is occasionally used as a storage area for lights, cables and other filming equipment.  On the photograph you can just see a staircase leading off to the right, which leads up to the ""platform"" area. In reality this stairway leads to a door into the building next door, which comes out as the exit of the men's toilets (also a set)!

Walford East Station
Walford East is the fictional tube station on  Turpin Road, Walford . It is on the London Underground District and Hammersmith & City Lines, replacing Bromley-by-Bow on the tube map. Locals use the station to travel into Central London or ""up west"". It has been the place that many characters have said their final goodbyes to the show.

History
1985-
In 1985, the Walford East Tube Station had not yet been constructed. It was constructed in around 2000. Since then it has been the regular tube station used for the residents fo Albert Square and surrounding areas to use when nipping ""Up West"" or to the airport.

“There is a good service running on all London Underground Lines…Bang On…Proper…”
As EastEnders celebrates its exciting 30th anniversary this week, London Underground passengers travelling via Bromley-By-Bow station on Wednesday 18 February will be treated to special station announcements from Danny Dyer throughout the day.
Putting his own spin on various announcements, Danny Dyer can be heard telling passengers to stand back from the closing doors and to ensure they’re using a valid ticket. Danny Dyer’s character, Mick Carter, is often found passing through the barriers of the fictional Walford East Station, which in the show replaces Bromley-by-Bow on the map.
Sandra Anderson, Area Manager for Bromley-By-Bow London Underground station, says: “Our station is at the heart of the East End and it is fantastic that as part of EastEnders’ 30th anniversary, our customers will be able to hear one of the most recognisable voices from the show telling them that there is a ‘right pukka’ service on the District line.”
Danny Dyer adds: “I can’t tell you how much I loved sitting in the Bromley-By-Bow control room with them lovely ladies in their blue coats who work tirelessly. I remember I used to go through there and get off at Mile End on the district line and change to the Central line to get to Stratford. It brought back some happy memories. So remember everyone - mind that gap.”

SHOULD there be pressing need to fill a column – and, in truth, when has there ever been anything else? – addressing Sutton under Whitestonecliffe Women’s Institute may be among the more agreeable ways of accomplishing it.
It’s a pleasant village near Thirsk , England’s longest place name, so breath taking that the coal-fired pub merely calls itself the Whitestonecliffe Inn and has done.
Wikipedia hyphenates it, villagers disconnect. The world’s longest place name, adds Wiki, is an 85-letter job which translates from the Maori as something about the mountain where the bloke with big knees serenaded his lover on a nose flute.
Britain’s is that familiar railway station village on Anglesey – where, coincidentally, the country’s first WI branch opened in 1915.
In South Africa, 27 letters translates as “The Upper End of Cut Throat Valley”; in southern Australia a 26-character name means “Where the devil urinates”.
SUTTON SIGN: Visitors arrive simply to photograph the sign
Not least because nothing much else happens – the notice board revealed little other than that the parish council is concerned about Himalayan balsam, which may be an eastern cousin of Japanese knotweed – locals are quite proud of their name.
“People come just to photograph the road sign,” said Marany Rowley, the WI secretary.
Similarly to great lengths, the talk went well. The previous meeting attracted four members; this one had around 30: nice people, great spread.
The school, the shop and the chapel are long gone. The further bad news is that, after 92 years, Sutton under Whitestonecliffe Women’s Institute will also cease to exist after the next annual meeting. That’s the long and the short of it, alas.
BRIEFER but similarly sized, Bellerby is also in North Yorkshire, near Leyburn. Once it may have been best known for a road sign which warned “Slow ducks crossing.”
Now we learn that the delightful Dorothy Walker, who until five years ago wasn’t even Bellerby’s oldest resident, has died. She was 108.
We’d first met at the Methodist Church harvest festival in 2007, thereafter invited to her birthday parties – or, at least, to some of them.
Dorothy rarely made do with only one.
She came to Bellerby at 21, taught at the village school, met her husband at the village hall dance – Bellerby of the ball, no doubt – played the parish church organ for 74 years and ever enjoyed the Wensleydale Tournament of Song.
Until recently she lived independently, washed her own windows and at 99 won £150 and a supply of dog food – the dog food was never properly explained – in Take a Break magazine’s crossword competition.
The minister called, faithfully, every Monday. “He does the clues I can’t,” she said.
Beattie Tupling, whose presence in the village allowed the At Your Service column to describe Dorothy as “Bellerby’s junior senior citizen”, died in 2009, aged 103.
A year later, the classified obits reported the passing in Boroughbridge of Mrs Joan Mary Thistlethwaite. She was 104 – and “formerly of Bellerby”. Whatever it did to the ducks, there must clearly be something in the water.
ENGLAND’S longest singleword place name is reckoned to be Cottonshopeburnfoot, a hamlet off the A68 in Northumberland which by one letter beats its neighbour, Blakehopeburnhaugh, into second place.
We thought about going on Sunday, decided that such lengths couldn’t be justified, and fell instead to contemplating the North-East’s next-longest name.
It could be Newton-under-Roseberry, near Guisborough , but as it wasn’t the weather for climbing Roseberrry Topping we went to Middleton- in-Teesdale instead.
This is what might be termed the Lambton Worm School of Journalism – you know, roaming about to pick up bits of news – though the real excitement had come a few days earlier when a fierce garage fire led to a 200-yard exclusion zone around the blazing property.
Probably it was Middleton’s biggest fire since the 1970s when the old Cosy Cinema went up and two of the village’s retained fire brigade – aged about 75 and 67 – had to be summoned from the Over-60s club.
Though they performed heroically, the county council still reduced the maximum age to 55.
The day was dank, the village hardware shop still prominently displaying something called an auto-extending emergency snow shovel, lest things become bleaker yet. A chap with a step ladder was putting fairy lights on a tree, as if it wasn’t just the weather was November-ish, but that Christmas was coming apace.
Another shop had a card advertising a Lord of the Rings Lego set for £65, or an extra £20 if already assembled.
It seemed rather to defeat the object.

De Palma's best known, but not best Hitchcock homage. Style triumphs over substance but it's still good fun.
20 January 2003 | by Infofreak
(Perth, Australia) – See all my reviews
'Dressed To Kill' was Brian De Palma's third Hitchcockian thriller, and his most successful. I don't necessarily mean artistically successful, but it still remains one of his best known movies, and is the one on which his reputation as ""that Hitchcock"" guy mainly rests on. De Palma has made all kinds of movies in his long career but it says a lot for the impact 'Dressed To Kill' had on audiences for him to be stereotyped like that by many movie lovers. In 'Sisters' De Palma paid tribute to 'Rear Window', in his underrated 'Obsession' it was 'Vertigo', and this time around 'Psycho' is the major inspiration. Some critics of De Palma complain he is more interested in style over substance, and in 'Dressed To Kill' there is some truth in that. You will probably guess the murderer after the first 20-25 minutes, then think to yourself ""no, that's just a red herring and there will be an unexpected twist later on"". You might then be a bit let down when the your initial guess turns out to be correct after all, but there are enough thrills and dazzling sequences throughout to keep most thriller fans happy. Michael Caine and Angie Dickinson are both pretty good in their respective roles, but Nancy Allen ('RoboCop') gives the real outstanding performance in the picture. De Palma would subsequently give her another good role in 'Blow Out' opposite John Travolta. Also strong are Keith Gordon (who went on to star in John Carpenter's 'Christine') and Dennis Franz ('NYPD Blue') in supporting roles. Personally I don't think 'Dressed To Kill' is as good as 'Sisters', but I still think it's first rate exploitation thriller and definitely worth watching. Not De Palma's most interesting movie by a long shot, but still one of his most watchable.

history
The so-called House of Dunkeld, in Scottish Gaelic  Dùn Chailleann (meaning Fort of the Caledonii or of the Caledonians), is a historiographical and genealogical construct to illustrate the clear succession of Scottish kings  from 1034 to 1040 and from 1058 to 1290.
It is dynastically sort of a continuation to Cenél nGabráin of Dál Riata, ""race of Fergus"", as ""house"" an originally Celtic concept to express one of the two rivalling leader clans of early medieval Scotland, whose founding father is king Fergus Mor of Dalriada. This Ferguside royal clan had rivalled the crown (of Dalriada, then that of Alba) against the Cenél Loairn, the later House of Moray for the preceding four or more centuries. The Cenél nGabráin were represented by the so-called House of Alpin before Dunkeld.
Sir Iain Moncreiffe made the case that Crínán of Dunkeld actually belonged to a Scottish sept of Irish Cenél Conaill royal dynasty.[1] This of course would not exclude his descendants from also being a (female line) continuation of the Cenél nGabráin through Bethóc.
Genealogically the Dunkeld dynasty is based on Duncan I of Scotland being of a different agnatic clan to his predecessor and maternal grandfather Malcolm II of Scotland. However, sociohistorically, the reign of Duncan's son Malcolm III of Scotland, which happens to coincide with the start of the centuries-long period of strong influence from the southern neighbour, the Kingdom of England, has been seen as a more important place to start.

Gordon Jackson, an Actor, at 66; Hudson in 'Upstairs, Downstairs'
AP
Published: January 16, 1990
LONDON, Jan. 15— Gordon Jackson, an actor known to millions of television viewers as Hudson, the archetypal butler in the popular series ''Upstairs, Downstairs,'' died on Sunday in Cromwell Hospital in London. He was 66 years old. The cause of death was not disclosed, but Mr. Jackson's agent, Michael Anderson, said the actor had been ill for a short time before being hospitalized.
The tall, ginger-haired Mr. Jackson, who brought his mellifluous Scottish accent to dozens of film, stage and television roles, started acting as a teen-ager soon after the outbreak of World War II. His career spanned nearly half a century and included more than 60 film credits, but he was best known for his portrayal of the stiff-upper-lipped butler in ''Upstairs, Downstairs,'' which ran from 1970 to 1975.
Won an Emmy in 1976
Mr. Jackson's work in the series won him a British Actor of the Year award in 1974 and an Emmy Award in 1976. Reruns of ''Upstairs, Downstairs'' are still being shown in the United States.
The actor, described as gentle and self-effacing by friends, once said: ''My trouble is that I'm underconfident and I'm too tentative. I'm not a go-getter and I never have been.
''It's only when the curtain goes up and the cameras start to roll that I don't enjoy this business.''
Mr. Jackson was born in Glasgow in 1923. He started an apprenticeship with Rolls-Royce in Edinburgh, but got his first professional acting job in 1941, playing a Scottish soldier in the film ''The Foreman Went to France,'' a story of Britons trapped in France in 1940 by the German invasion.
Films He Appeared In
His film credits included ''Somewhere in France'' in 1943, ''Whisky Galore'' in 1948, ''Happy Go Lovely'' in 1951, ''Tunes of Glory'' in 1960, ''Mutiny on the Bounty'' in 1961, 'The Great Escape'' in 1962, ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie'' in 1968 and ''The Whistle Blower'' in 1986.
He also played the tough undercover police chief Cowley in the British television thriller series ''The Professionals'' from 1977 to 1981, and was in the 1981 Australian mini-series ''A Town Like Alice,'' and a 1988 television movie, ''Noble House.''
On stage, he played Banquo in ''Macbeth,'' Horatio in ''Hamlet,'' Malvolio in ''Twelfth Night'' and a host of other characters in London's West End. His theater credits also included roles in a 1970 Stratford, Ontario, production of Ibsen's ''Hedda Gabler.''
He is survived by his wife, Rona, and two sons.

The second trial of Harvey Phillip Spector for the murder of Lana Clarkson was dominated by one phrase: ""I think I killed someone."" The 69-year-old record producer, creator of pop's ""wall of sound"", was said to have uttered that phrase as he emerged from his home in the small hours of Monday, 3 February 2003.
Behind him, slumped in a fake Louis XIV chair, lay the body of Clarkson, a 40-year-old actor he had met earlier that night when she was working at the House of Blues venue on the Sunset Strip
The full force of Los Angeles's celebrity crime armada descended: news helicopters hovered overhead, high-priced lawyers – celebrities in their own right – were summoned, news crews and the idly curious gathered to peer through the iron railings of Spector's home.
Spector, too, played the part, seeming to revel in a return to the spotlight. He provided other staples of the Hollywood justice story: the tirade on the steps of the courthouse, the elaborate and downright weird hairdo, the rococo attire, the trophy wife, the phalanx of bodyguards. ""She kissed the gun,"" he told one interviewer.
While the first trial was dominated by forensics and the finer points on how blood spatters, the rerun came down to an elaborate game of did he, didn't he, involving meditations on memory, suggestibility and English language proficiency.
At the centre of the dispute was Spector's stand-in chauffeur on the night of Clarkson's death, Adriano de Souza, a Brazilian student who proved an unflappable witness. Despite his occasional awkwardness with English, De Souza recounted how he had collected Spector for an evening out that had seen him visit a clutch of Hollywood haunts, Trader Vic's and Dan Tana's, imbibe a huge amount of alcohol – ""navy grog"", 150-proof tequila – and share his evening with two dates before ending at the House of Blues.
There, Spector met Clarkson, an actor whose role, far removed from the showbusiness recognition she craved, was to guard the VIP area. Initially she took the freakishly coiffed Spector for a woman, before being corrected by the management and told to treat him ""like gold"".
After some persuasion she agreed to go home with Spector for a nightcap, watching Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye in the back of the Mercedes S430 limousine driven by De Souza on the way to ""Phil Spector's Pyrenees castle"", a 33-room turreted mansion perched on a hill in the unprepossessing Los Angeles suburb of Alhambra. Two hours later, she was dead.
For the second trial, almost six years after Clarkson's death, Spector downsized. Gone was the retinue of heavies that had marched into court with him every day the first time around. He was accompanied by just one bodyguard, and his young wife, Rachelle. His legal team was reduced to a single lawyer, Doron Weinberg. Facing him was the same lead prosecutor from the first trial, Alan Jackson.
Without the theatrics of that trial, Weinberg's speciality was studied doubt. De Souza, he noted, had been through eight variations of the phrase ""I think I killed someone"" in recounting events to investigators. Surely that suggested sufficient doubt to acquit, Weinberg argued.","The context explicitly states that Phil Spector was convicted of Lana Clarkson's murder in 2009, with the conviction occurring on April 13, 2009. Multiple sources within the context confirm this, including the article titled ""How Phil Spector was convicted of the murder of Lana Clarkson"" and the trial details.",36,1,1,1,1,1

Education Education The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Prince Harry Residences Education On 10th May 1955, Buckingham Palace announced that The Prince would go to school, rather than have a private tutor as had previous Heirs to The Throne. The Prince, who had received private tuition in the Palace nursery for 18 months from his governess Catherine Peebles, attended Hill House School in West London full time from 28th January 1957. On 14th August 1957, Buckingham Palace announced that The Prince would attend Cheam, the preparatory school at Headley, near Newbury, Berks, which had been attended by his father from 1930 to 1933. The Prince began his first term on 23rd September 1957. The school days began at 7.15am with the rising bell, prayers were at 7.45, breakfast was at 8 and lessons began at 9. After a 6pm high tea, bedtime for the younger boys was 6.45pm. During five years at Cheam, The Prince played cricket for the First Eleven, joined in school games of football and rugby, and took part in amateur dramatics. He was appointed head boy in his final year. The Prince had started his time at Cheam as the eight-year-old Duke of Cornwall. He left on 1st April 1962 as the 13-year-old Prince of Wales. Buckingham Palace announced on 23rd January 1962, that The Prince of Wales would attend Gordonstoun, the public school on the shores of the Moray Firth in Scotland. The Prince's father, The Duke of Edinburgh, had been among the first pupils when the school was opened in 1934 by Dr Kurt Hahn. Dr Hahn had developed a regime founded on belief in an egalitarian society, with firm principles of human conduct: the strong must be courteous to the weak, and service to others is more important than self-service. On 1st May 1962, The Prince was taken to Gordonstoun by The Duke of Edinburgh, who piloted a Heron of the Queen's Flight from Heathrow to RAF Lossiemouth before the final drive to the school. From February to July 1966, The Prince of Wales spent two terms at Timbertop, a remote annexe of Geelong Church of England Grammar School in Melbourne, Australia. While attending Timbertop, The Prince joined in a school trip to Papua New Guinea, led by his history tutor Michael Persse. After seeing examples of the folk art of the Papuan people, The Prince expressed concern in an essay that traditions there were being allowed to wither, a theme he took up later in his life. When The Prince returned to Gordonstoun for his final year, he was made school guardian, or Head Boy and, after years of communal living, was given his own study bedroom. In March 1967 he played the Pirate King in a school production of Gilbert and Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance. The Prince, the first Heir to The Throne to sit public examinations, took his GCE O Levels at the age of 16, passing English language, English literature, Latin, French and history - and later mathematics. He took his A Levels in July 1967, getting a B in history and a C in French, also gaining a distinction in an optional special paper in history. The Prince went on to university, rather than straight into the Armed Forces, and in Autumn 1967 he arrived at Trinity College, Cambridge. The Prince’s grandfather, King George VI, had studied history, economics and civics for a year at the same college, from October 1919. The Prince chose to take a first year course in archaeology and physical and social anthropology and arrived at Trinity College on 8th October 1967. In March and April 1968, The Prince of Wales spent time studying archaeological sites in France and taking part in excavations in Jersey. On 8th April 1968, it was announced that The Prince had decided to change from archaeology and anthropology to history from the next academic year starting in October. In his first examination at Cambridge, the results of which were published on 14th June 1968, The Prince was awarded a 2:1 in the first part of the archaeology and anthropology exams. In April 1969, The Prince of Wales left Cambridge to spend a term at the University College of Wales in Aberystwyth, where he studied Welsh and the history of the Principality. The Prince left the University College of Wales in June 1969, a week before his Investiture as Prince of Wales by The Queen at Caernarfon on 1st July.","The context explicitly mentions that Prince Charles attended Gordonstoun School, and that his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, was among the first pupils when the school was opened in 1934. Therefore, both the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles attended Gordonstoun School.",37,1,1,1,1,1

qz_2977,Which architect was known as the Wizard of the Dome?,Buckminster Fuller,"Dome (architecture) I. Introduction. Dome (architecture), a roof or vault, usually hemispherical in form. Until the 19th century, domes were constructed of masonry ... Dome (architecture) I. Introduction Dome (architecture), a roof or vault, usually hemispherical in form. Until the 19th century, domes were constructed of masonry, of wood, or of combinations of the two, frequently reinforced with iron chains around the base to counteract the outward thrust of the structure. Since then, as industrial technology developed, domes have been constructed of cast iron, reinforced concrete, steel, aluminum, laminated wood, or plastic. II. Origins The dome seems to have developed as roofing for circular mud-brick huts in ancient Mesopotamia about 6000 years ago. In the 14th century BC the Mycenaean Greeks built tombs roofed with steep corbeled domes in the shape of pointed beehives (tholos tombs). Otherwise, the dome was not important in ancient Greek architecture. The Romans developed the masonry dome in its purest form, culminating in the Pantheon, a temple built (AD 118-128) by the emperor Hadrian. Set on a massive circular drum 6 m (20 ft) thick that conceals eight interlocked masonry piers, the coffered dome rises 43 m (142 ft) to form a perfect hemisphere on the interior, with a large oculus (eye) in its center to admit light. The use of domes was continued in the Early Christian period for relatively small circular structures such as mausoleums and baptisteries. A typical example is the Church of Santa Costanza (350?), Rome, originally the tomb of Constantia, daughter of the emperor Constantine the Great. Byzantine architects were far more inventive in their use of domes. In the Byzantine capital of Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), a succession of large domed churches reached its apogee in Hagia Sophia (Church of the Holy Wisdom), built (532-537) for the emperor Justinian I. Its shallow dome, 31 m (100 ft) wide and ringed with windows at its base, is supported on four pendentives (spherical triangles) backed by immense exterior piers and by a series of half-domes. After the fall (1453) of Constantinople to the Seljuk Turks, Hagia Sophia was converted to a mosque and became the model for a number of vast domed mosques built throughout the Ottoman Empire in subsequent centuries. Even before that, however, there was a long tradition of Islamic domed buildings (palaces, mosques, tombs, and baths); the Dome of the Rock (691) in Jerusalem is one of the earliest examples. Set on a pillared arcade, its double dome is of timber construction. Perhaps the most famous Islamic structure is the Taj Mahal in Agra, India, built (1632-1648) by the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his favorite wife. Its slightly bulbous white marble dome rises on a tall drum over a spacious equilateral building. III. Renaissance, Baroque, and Neoclassical Domes The first great Italian Renaissance dome was the majestic octagonal dome built (1420-1436) by the architect Filippo Brunelleschi for Florence Cathedral. The immense structure, 39 m (130 ft) in diameter and 91 m (300 ft) tall, is topped with a lantern 16 m (52 ft) high, and consists of an outer roof shielding an inner masonry shell. The 8 primary ribs and 16 secondary ribs form a tightly interlocked masonry cage. In Rome the rebuilding of Saint Peter's Basilica occupied several generations of Renaissance architects. A plan for a Greek-cross (equal-armed) church, with a monumental dome over the crossing, was finally begun (1546) under the supervision of Michelangelo. Its awesome multiribbed dome, 41.7 m (137 ft) in diameter, became the prototype for domes throughout the world. The most notable baroque domes in northern Europe were built in Paris and London. Jules Hardouin-Mansart built (1676-1706) the resplendent Church of Saint Louis des Invalides in Paris. Its dome (28 m/92 ft wide) is set on two unusually tall drums pierced with large windows that flood the interior with light. Sir Christopher Wren's noble dome for Saint Paul's Cathedral (1675-1711), London, incorporates a shallow inner dome, a conical masonry shell supporting the high lantern, and an outer lead-sheathed dome of timber. The 1792 competition for the design of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., was won by an amateur architect, Dr. William Thornton, whose scheme called for a central block topped with a hemispherical domelike that of the Roman Pantheonflanked by two legislative wings. After this structure was burned by the British in 1814, the architect Benjamin Latrobe planned its reconstruction, which was finally finished under Charles Bulfinch's direction in 1830. Thomas U. Walter was commissioned to enlarge it in 1850. Dominating the sprawling white marble building and the city's skyline is Walter's soaring cast-iron dome, 27.4 (92 ft) in diameter (completed in 1863), which has served as the model for many state capitol buildings. Another neoclassical example is the domed Rotunda created between 1817 and 1825 by statesman and architect Thomas Jefferson for the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. IV. 20th-Century Domes The technological developments of the 20th century have radically changed the concept and construction of the dome. Thus the geodesic dome, patented by the American inventor R. Buckminster Fuller in 1947, is composed of a lattice of interlocking tetrahrons and octahedrons made of lightweight materials, leaving the interior free of structural supports. Its many uses are exemplified by the Climatron, the gigantic climate-controlled botanical garden completed in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1960. Demand for geodesic domes increased in the 1990s because of their energy efficiency. Steel-dome construction dates to the late 19th century but was spectacularly adapted to sports arena use in the Astrodome, completed in Houston, Texas, in 1965. Its plastic roof is 195 m (642 ft) wide at the bottom tension ring of the structure. Reinforced concrete is also used in modern dome construction, as in the Palazetto dello Sport created in Rome by the Italian architect-designer Pier Luigi Nervi for the 1960 Olympic Games; its precast units are united by poured-in-place concrete ribs.","The context mentions Buckminster Fuller in the section about 20th-century domes, specifically regarding the geodesic dome he invented. The nickname ""Wizard of the Dome"" is one of the aliases associated with Buckminster Fuller in the answer section, confirming that he was known by this title.",36,1,1,1,1,1

About the village of Bagshot, Surrey
maps
Bagshot is in the North West corner of both the county of Surrey and the diocese of Guildford. It is situated on the A30 (London to Southampton and the South West of England) where this is crossed by the Guildford to Reading road. The M3 motorway forms Bagshot's southern boundary and the village is immediately adjacent to junction 3.
The neighbouring villages are: Windlesham, Sunningdale and Chobham to the east, Lightwater and Bisley to the south, and Frimley to the south west. Local towns are Camberley some 5 miles (8 km) to the south-west, Bracknell about 5 miles (8km) north-east, Windsor 10 miles (16 km) north, Woking 8 miles (13 km) south east and the Cathedral town of Guildford 12 miles (20 km) south. London Heathrow airport is about 15 miles (24 km) drive.
Geography
Bagshot is on the outer edge of the 'green belt' (an area surrounding London in which development is restricted in order to contain the urban spread), the natural vegetation of the area is heath land (from which the administrative borough of Surrey Heath derives its name). The village is separated from its neighbours by open land, most of it heath. Much of this surrounding land is owned by the Ministry of Defence, and some is Royal Estate.
The village is compact and the housing extends over less than 2 miles (3 km).
History
Bagshot is of Saxon origin, originally in a parish with Windlesham. Coaching inns were the major reason for Bagshot's original prosperity (the village is on the main road from London to the West Country), together with a Royal hunting lodge favoured by the Stuart kings (now known as Bagshot Park and which is again a Royal residence with its occupation by Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex).
See here for more about the origins of Bagshot .
Growth of the village occurred during the first half of the 19th century, largely due to the coaching trade and agriculture, especially market gardening. The opening of the main line railway from London to Southampton and beyond in 1838 destroyed the coaching trade with a resultant depression, but the opening of the local railway line 20 years later promoted renewed growth, particularly with the nursery gardens being better able to supply London's Covent Garden market.
Bagshot separated from Windlesham to become its own ecclesiastical parish in 1874 and the Church was built 10 years later, largely with the patronage of the Duke of Connaught.
St Anne's Church has twice been honoured by a visit from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother , on the first occasion to commemorate the centenary of the building, and more recently to unveil a memorial plaque to Lady Patricia Ramsay ( Princess Patricia ).
Development, Housing & Infrastructure
There is a three-tier local government structure: Surrey County Council ; Surrey Heath Borough Council and Windlesham Parish Council (local government names in rural areas can cause some confusion as a Parish Council is the smallest unit of local government, it is unconnected with the church).
Significant growth has occurred in the size of the village since the 1950's, and especially since the late 60's. The general area having been earmarked in the national and county strategic plans for growth. Most of the housing has been built as diverse estates, though none is excessively large and the essential characteristics of a large village have not been destroyed.
There is an adequate range of shops centred on the High Street. Perhaps still harking back to Bagshot's coaching origins, there are a surprising number of public houses, restaurants and 'take away' cooked food vendors, a lot of their trade coming from outside the village.
Recreation facilities in Bagshot are afforded by two multi-use sports fields and a cricket field . Each have a pavilion / social club and one used to have a youth centre run by the county. There is a tennis club and several local golf clubs. An indoor centre with comprehensive facilities including swimming is available in Camberley, other facilities abound in the area. The members of the cricket club are trying to date the origins of cricket in Bagshot,  information about the club or old photographs especially in the 19th century.

Hippety Hopper | Looney Tunes Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia
Hippety Hopper is an animated cartoon character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes series of cartoons.
History
Robert McKimson introduced Hippety Hopper in Hop, Look and Listen (1948), which created the mold into which future Hippety Hopper cartoons would fall: baby kangaroo Hopper escapes from the zoo, the circus, etc., and is mistaken for a giant mouse by Sylvester the cat. Sylvester then tries to capture and eat his ""prey"", but the innocent and infantile Hippety mistakes Sylvester's predations for a game — a game of rough-housing, to be exact. Sylvester is repeatedly punched, kicked, juggled, spun, and pounced, but each failure only cements his will to have the ""mouse"" for lunch. The cat's dignity will suffer no less.
After Hippety Hopper (1949), the first cartoon where the character is officially named, the character would later return in McKimson's Pop 'Im Pop! (1950) in which proud papa Sylvester boasts of his mousing skills to his son, Sylvester Junior . Also in 1950, Hippety made a cameo in the Bugs Bunny cartoon Bushy Hare , which is the only time he talks.
In Cat's A-Weigh , (1953) Sylvester accepts a position as mouse-catcher on a ship. He encounters Hippety Hopper being shipped from Australia. Sylvester mistakes Hippety Hopper once again for a giant mouse, and the baby kangaroo promptly beats the cat to a pulp. Junior is mortified, but the true victim is Sylvester, humiliated by a mere ""mouse"" in front of his own son.
Mckimson would continue the Sylvester/Hippety Hopper series for 16 years, varying it slightly from cartoon to cartoon. In Bell Hoppy (1954), for example, Sylvester must hang a bell around a mouse's neck in order to join the ""Loyal Order of Alley Cats and Mousing and Chowder Club.""
In Lighthouse Mouse , Sylvester must guard a lighthouse from the baby kangaroo who wants nothing more than to turn it off. Hoppy Go Lucky (1952) was a parody of Of Mice and Men, with Sylvester accompanied by the giant, simple-minded cat named ""Benny"" who wants a mouse to ""hug and pet."" The central theme is always the same: Sylvester is shamed for his failure to capture a simple ""mouse"".
The Hippety Hopper/Sylvester cartoons ended in 1964 when the Warner Bros. studio closed its animation unit, with Freudy Cat as Hippety's final appearance. The character continues to appear in Looney Tunes marketing and other projects, such as some cameo appearances in the crowd shots of the 1996 film Space Jam and the very end of the 2003 movie, Looney Tunes: Back in Action . In an episode of The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries set in Australia, Sylvester stumbles into a group of baby kangaroos, who all resemble Hippety, and comments that this is the first time he had seen the ""giant mice"" for years.
In April 2013, a DVD called Looney Tunes Super Stars' Sylvester & Hippety Hopper: Marsupial Mayhem was released, containing all the Hippety Hopper/Sylvester cartoons.

Gjetost cheese, pronounced ""YAY-toast"" by Americans or ""yed-OOST"" by Scandinavians, is also known as Brunost cheese. Gjetost is a brown Norwegian cheese made of goat's milk or a blend of goat and cow's milk. Gjetost Cheese from Norway is produced by slowly heating a vat of whey, cream and milk. This is why Gjetost is sometimes called a whey cheese. The caramel brown color of Gjetost Cheese is a result of the caramelization of the milk's sugars during this heating process. Gjetost Cheese History Gjetost Cheese originated in the Gudbrandsdalen valley of Norway over one hundred years ago. Gjetost has always been sweet like butterscotch with a dense, rich texture. Gjetost is formed into rindless squares or cylinders, and is best when sliced wafer thin and enjoyed open-faced on Norwegian flatbread served with fresh fruit. It is no wonder children are drawn the taste of this unique, sweet-like-fudge cheese. Often enjoyed as a breakfast cheese in Norway, Gjetost also makes an excellent snack and is the perfect dessert cheese. This unique Norwegian brown cheese is also known as Brunost, which is simply Norwegian for Brown Cheese. The Ski Queen variety is a blend of cow and goat's milk, whereas the Ekte Gjetost Cheese from Norway is made from 100% goat's milk. Gjetost is packed with energy and is extremely tolerant of temperature fluctuations. Because of these benefits, Gjetost is a preferred snack for Norwegians skiiers, who pack it in their backpacks and snack on it while on the trails. This is where the Ski Queen brand name comes from, and may be one of the secrets to the international success of Norwegian cross-country skiiers.

Start Shopping Gjetost ""Ski Queen"" | Country Cheese Company In stock in last couple of weeks?: Yes Pronounced ""Yay-toast."" It's Norwegian, and although the name translates directly to ""goat cheese,"" chances are that this cheese tastes just about as far from any you've had before. Gjetost is as sweet as caramel, with the texture of a dense, buttery fudge. Gjetost is a variety of Scandinavian brown cheese (brunost), often refered to as Ski cheese or Ski Queen. Like ricotta, Gjetost comes from whey-- that is, the liquid by-product of cheesemaking. But while ricotta is fresh, ready in a matter of minutes, Gjetost is a time-consuming process which requires slow and continuous heating of whey, cream, and milk. Over many hours, the milk sugars are cooked to the point of caramelization. Its colour and unique taste are the product of the natural caramelization of the sugar in milk (lactose) that occurs during the cheese's production process. Gjetost is a concentrated, sweet block that tastes more like butterscotch than like actual cheese. The thick but almost spreadable consistency of Gjetost lends itself well to anything crisp and crunchy, be it crackers, toasted bread, or thinly sliced apples and pears.

Weather forecasters are warning us that tomorrow's storm could be the worst for decades .
And the fact that it has been named after St Jude - the patron saint of lost causes - isn't exactly reassuring.
We've been told to expect winds of up to 90mph, torrential rain, travel chaos and possible disruptions to the power supply , so perhaps we should start to despair.
But Monday also happens to be the feast day for this particular saint, so it might not be all bad news.
So who was St Jude? Here are the 10 things you need to know about the patron saint of lost causes and desperate cases...
1. St Jude was one of Jesus' 12 apostles, chosen to spread the word of the gospel.
2. He was also known as Thaddeus or Thaddaeus - said to be a surname for the name Labbaeus which means ""heart"" or courageous"".
3. He is believed to have written the book of Jude. Religious scholars say it contains some of the finest expressions of praise to God in the Bible's New Testament.
4. Jude became associated with desperate situations because of a letter he wrote to the Churches of the East. In it he says that the faithful must keep going even in harsh or difficult circumstances.
5. He is thought to have been martyred in Beirut in around 65 AD, along with fellow apostle Simon the Zealot. He is often depicted showing a club or axe, symbolising the way he died.
6. He is also sometimes pictured with a flame above his head. This refers to the Pentecost, where he and the other apostles received the Holy Spirit.
7. The personal ads sections of some newspapers occasionally include messages from people calling on St Jude for help in times of need, or thanking him for his support and guidance.
8. Some choose to carry the image of St Jude on a medal or as a pendant on a necklace to provide comfort.
9. The Shrine of St Jude can be found at the parish church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Faversham, Kent. It was set up in the 1950s by the church's friars, who noticed they were getting an increasing number of requests for St Jude prayer cards. Donations to ""The Shrine of St Jude"" began to come in, but one didn't exist - so Friar Elias Lynch set one up. The shrine is visited all year round, but particularly on St Jude's feast day - October 28.
10. St Jude is not to be confused with Judas Iscariot - another of the 12 apostles, but the one who betrayed Jesus.

The Apostle Saint Jude Thaddeus is ""The Miraculous Saint,"" the Catholic Patron Saint of ""lost causes"" and ""cases despaired of.""When all other avenues are closed, he is the one to call upon, and his help often comes at the last moment.

BBC ON THIS DAY | 15 | 1997: Versace murdered on his doorstep 1997: Versace murdered on his doorstep Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace has been shot dead on the steps of his Miami mansion. The incident happened shortly before 0900 local time (1400 GMT) as the 50-year-old designer returned from the fashionable News Caf� where he bought breakfast and Italian newspapers. Witnesses described a white man in his mid-twenties taking a gun from a backpack and shooting Versace twice in the back of the head as he unlocked the gates to his Ocean Drive home. A gun was found with discarded clothes in a red Chevrolet pick-up truck abandoned in a car park. Prime suspect Police have traced the weapon to Andrew Cunanan, 27, a gay prostitute with an ""affluent clientele"". He is already on the FBI's most wanted list in connection with four other murders - all of the victims were, like Versace, homosexual. Miami police chief Richard Barreto described Cunanan as the sole suspect, but he did not know if he had any relationship with Versace. Hundreds of people have gathered opposite Versace's three-storey, Mediterranean style home, the only residential building in the art deco section of Ocean Drive. Police have sealed off the area round the blood-stained steps to the house - Casa Casuarina - where Versace lived most of the time with his friend Antonio D'Amico. Around the world Versace's stores have been closing as they received news of the tragedy. Tributes are pouring in from the many rich and famous friends who enjoyed wearing Versace's flamboyant designs. Amongst them Princess Diana has issued a statement saying she was ""devastated at the loss of a great and talented man"". Versace had just released his new winter collection and a glamorous television launch planned for the Spanish Steps in Rome has been cancelled. With the help of his sister Donatella and his brother Santo, Versace transformed the family firm into a multimillion-dollar fashion empire.","The context explicitly states that Gianni Versace, an Italian fashion designer, was shot dead on the steps of his Miami mansion in 1997.

Mrs. Merton : [interviewing Debbie McGee - Mrs Paul Daniels] What was it that first attracted you to millionaire Paul Daniels?
(Isle Of Bute , Scotland) – See all my reviews
This is a spoof chat show with Caroline Ahearne playing OAP Mrs Merton . The concept is that Mrs Merton will invite celebrities who are in on the joke onto the show and ask them cheeky questions :
To lorraine Kelly : "" What plans do you have for the menopause ? ""
To Debbie McGee : "" What attracted you to the millonaire Paul Daniels ""
I've no idea if anyone phoned up to complain about Mrs Merton asking these type of personal questions ( Spoof chat show KNOWING ME KNOWING YOU did receive a barrage of complaints about the presenter Alan Partridge ! ) but one edition did feature a record number of complaints about one of its guests Bernard Manning
For those who don't know Bernard Manning is an old hat working mans club comedian . The reason he's rarely seen is because
a ) He wasn't all that funny to start with
b ) His jokes usually involve outrageous racist comments
So maybe he wasn't the greatest guest to have on in the first place , I mean it's not like he was going to go down well on a light hearted spoof chat show . He was seated next to the previous guest Richard Wilson and they both got into a heated argument with Manning making comments about Asians during the war and stating that because some people might have been born in England this in no way makes them English
"" So Bernard "" Asked Mrs Merton "" Apart from Aldoph Hitler who else do you admire ? ""

Skeleton Equipment and History - Olympic Sport History Sports History Skeleton racing involves plummeting head-first down a steep and treacherous ice track on a tiny sled. It is considered the world's first sliding sport. Thrill-seeking tourists Sleighing is one of the oldest winter sports. Descriptions of the sport can be found in 16th-century literature, but as a racing sport it can be traced to the mid-19th century, when British tourists started sliding down snowbound roads in the Alps. British and American holidaymakers built the first toboggan run in Davos in 1882. The Cresta run Skeleton sled racing owes it entire early history to St Moritz and the famed Cresta Run. The sport developed in the Swiss resort town as a pursuit for the rich. E. F. Benson put it best when he wrote in 1913, “There is one Mecca, there is one St Peter's, and there is one Cresta.” Olympic history Men’s skeleton made two early appearances on the Olympic programme at its “ancestral” home of St. Moritz in 1928 and 1948. It was then dropped until it reappeared as a men’s and women’s event at Salt Lake City in 2002. 1948 Sankt Moritz Winter Games | Olympics at Sports-Reference.com 1948 Sankt Moritz Winter Games Host City: Sankt Moritz, Switzerland (January 30, 1948 to February 8, 1948) Opening Ceremony: January 30, 1948 (opened by President Enrico Celio) Taker of the Olympic Oath: Bibi Torriani (athlete) Closing Ceremony: February 8, 1948 Events: 22 in 9 sports Participants: 668 (591 men and 77 women) from 28 countries Youngest Participant: Muzaffer Demirhan (15 years, 200 days) Oldest Participant: James Coates (53 years, 295 days) Most Medals (Athlete): Most Medals (Country): 3 countries with 10 medals Overview The world returned to Winter Olympia after an enforced absence of 12 years. St. Moritz was chosen because all of the sites that they had used in 1928 were still available and the Swiss resort could organize the Games much quicker than any other city, with the possible exception of Germany's 1936 site, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, which was not even considered. In fact, Germany and its Axis partner, Japan, were not invited to the Olympic Games in 1948 in either St. Moritz or London. » Click to show/hide rest of overview Another small political protest occurred when Lebanon, the only Arab state entered, protested the entry of a Palestine team, which actually represented the nascent Jewish state, was composed of an all-Jewish team, and planned on carrying a Zionist flag. Fortunately, the Palestine team withdrew because the team did not have adequate time to prepare. St. Moritz hurriedly put together excellent arrangements for the Games that were again disturbed, though less severely, by the Föhn. This time ice hockey matches (held outdoors) and the 10,000 metres speed skating had to be delayed but no events were cancelled this time, as they had been in 1928. Alpine skiing made its true Olympic début. A combined event had been held in 1936 but this time there were three events for both men and women. Two athletes won a second ""St. Moritz"" Olympic medal, as [""Bibi"" Torriani] played on the Swiss ice hockey team to match his bronze from 1928; and [Jack Heaton] (USA) also repeated his silver medal from the [skeleton race in 1928] on the famed Cresta Run. The skeleton race, a form of tobogganing unique to the St. Moritz resort, was held at the Olympics for only the second time, and some thought, last time. But skeleton was restored to the Olympic Program and returned to the Olympics in 2002 at Salt Lake City.","The context explicitly states that the Cresta Run is located in St. Moritz, Switzerland, and that it hosted skeleton races during the 1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics.

Copyright The Columbia University Press wireworm, elongate, cylindrical larva of the click beetle . Most wireworms are hard and brown, but members of some species are soft and whitish. Wireworms live in rotten wood or in the ground and feed on roots and seeds, injuring potatoes, grasses, and a wide variety of leguminous field crops. They live for 2 to 10 years before pupating in the ground or in wood. Methods of control include letting the land lie fallow, rotating crops, and special methods of cultivation. Wireworms are classified in the phylum Arthropoda , class Insecta, order Coleoptera, family Elateridae. See bulletins of the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture. Cite this article Pick a style below, and copy the text for your bibliography. MLA Wireworm-true and false Wireworm-true and false True wireworm (adult and larva). False wireworm (adult and larva). Old wireworm damage (left) and fresh damage (right) on sweetpotato storage roots. General information True and false wireworms are the larval stages of two types of beetles. The adults of true wireworms are commonly called click beetles while the adults of false wireworms are known as darkling beetles. There are 667 different species of true wireworms found in Australia. BSES entomologists identified 26 species of true wireworm in established cane fields in north, central and southern Queensland and in New South Wales. Scientific name True wireworms of recorded agronomic importance in Australia include potato wireworm (Hapatesus hirtus) and sugarcane wireworm (Agrypnus variabilis). False wireworms are major soil insect pests of establishing summer and winter crops in Queensland and New South Wales. False wireworms of agronomic importance in Australia include northern false wireworm (Gonocephalum carpentariae),           southern false wireworm (Gonocephalum macleayi), small false wireworm (Gonocephalum misellum), eastern false wireworm (Pterohelaeus darlingensis) and striate false wireworm (Pterohelaeus alternatus). Life history The lifecycle of true wireworms varies greatly between species. For example, sugarcane wireworm takes one year with four larval instars to complete its cycle whilst the potato wireworm takes approximately four years with 10 larval instars. Summary of the lifecycle of the sugarcane wireworm (a true wireworm): Beetles emerge in October-November and migrate if habitat is not suitable. Female beetles require food (green leaf material) before they begin egg laying. Females lay eggs in November-February in batches of approximately 10 to 15 eggs. Eggs are laid on soil surface or           in small crevices. Once larvae have emerged they generally remain in the top 50 mm of the soil profile during the first instar stage. Later larval instars will move deeper in the soil profile in response to moisture and temperature. Sugarcane wireworm take ten months and four instars for larvae to fully develop in SE           Queensland. Once larvae mature (in September-October) they hollow out small soil cells to pupate within. This stage generally takes about two weeks. The lifecycles of the major false wireworm pest species are all similar: In central Queensland beetles emerge in October-January and migrate if the habitat is not suitable. Female beetles require food (green leaf material) before they begin egg laying. One month after emergence the females begin laying eggs on           the soil surface or just below. Egg laying may continue for up to 20 weeks but is terminated by cool weather. Females are capable of laying 1000 eggs or more. Once larvae have emerged they generally remain in the top 50 mm of the soil profile and are relatively immobile. Larvae develop through autumn, winter and spring. It is not possible to distinguish between larvae instars. They are believed to have up to 11 instars. [...]","The context explicitly states that wireworms are the larval stages of two types of beetles, and they are classified in the phylum Arthropoda, class Insecta, order Coleoptera, family Elateridae. This confirms that wireworms are indeed beetles.",33,1,1,1,1,1
