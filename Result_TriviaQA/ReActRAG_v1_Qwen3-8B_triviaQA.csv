Other posts during the next few years included Chief Secretary of Ireland (1887), First Lord of the Treasury (1892) and leader of the House of Commons (1892). Balfour replaced his uncle as Prime Minister in 1902. The most important events during his premiership included the 1902 Education Act and the ending of the Boer War.

If I Were a Rich Man Lyrics - Fiddler on the Roof Soundtrack Lyrics
Fiddler on the Roof Soundtrack Lyrics
""Dear God, you made many, many poor people.
I realize, of course, that it's no shame to be poor.
But it's no great honor either!
So, what would have been so terrible if I had a small fortune?""
If I were a rich man,
Ya ha deedle deedle, bubba bubba deedle deedle dum.
All day long I'd biddy biddy bum.
If I were a wealthy man.
I wouldn't have to work hard.
Ya ha deedle deedle, bubba bubba deedle deedle dum.
If I were a biddy biddy rich,
Yidle-diddle-didle-didle man.
I'd build a big tall house with rooms by the dozen,
Right in the middle of the town.
A fine tin roof with real wooden floors below.
There would be one long staircase just going up,
And one even longer coming down,
And one more leading nowhere, just for show.
I'd fill my yard with chicks and turkeys and geese and ducks
For the town to see and hear.
And each loud ""cheep"" and ""swaqwk"" and ""honk"" and ""quack""
Would land like a trumpet on the ear,
As if to say ""Here lives a wealthy man.""
If I were a rich man,
Ya ha deedle deedle, bubba bubba deedle deedle dum.
All day long I'd biddy biddy bum.
If I were a wealthy man.
I wouldn't have to work hard.
Ya ha deedle deedle, bubba bubba deedle deedle dum.
If I were a biddy biddy rich,
Yidle-diddle-didle-didle man.
I see my wife, my Golde, looking like a rich man's wife
With a proper double-chin.
Supervising meals to her heart's delight.
I see her putting on airs and strutting like a peacock.
Oy, what a happy mood she's in.
Screaming at the servants, day and night.
The most important men in town would come to fawn on me!
They would ask me to advise them,
Like a Solomon the Wise.
""If you please, Reb Tevye...""
""Pardon me, Reb Tevye...""
Posing problems that would cross a rabbi's eyes!
And it won't make one bit of difference if i answer right or wrong.
When you're rich, they think you really know!
If I were rich, I'd have the time that I lack
To sit in the synagogue and pray.
And maybe have a seat by the Eastern wall.
And I'd discuss the holy books with the learned men, several hours every day.
That would be the sweetest thing of all.
If I were a rich man,
Ya ha deedle deedle, bubba bubba deedle deedle dum.
All day long I'd biddy biddy bum.

tc_397,"In Lewis Carroll's poem The Hunting of the Snark, what did the elusive, troublesome snark turn into to fool hunters?",A boojum,"The Hunting of the Snark (An Agony in 8 Fits) is typically categorized as a nonsense poem written by Lewis Carroll, the pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. Written from 1874 to 1876, the poem borrows the setting, some creatures, and eight portmanteau words from Carroll's earlier poem ""Jabberwocky"" in his children's novel Through the Looking Glass (1871). The plot follows a crew of ten trying to hunt the Snark, an animal which may turn out to be a highly dangerous Boojum. The only one of the crew to find the Snark quickly vanishes, leading the narrator to explain that it was a Boojum after all. The poem is dedicated to young Gertrude Chataway, whom Carroll met at the English seaside town Sandown in the Isle of Wight in 1875. Included with many copies of the first edition of the poem was Carroll's religious tract, An Easter Greeting to Every Child Who Loves ""Alice"". The Hunting of the Snark was published by Macmillan in the United Kingdom in late March 1876, with illustrations by Henry Holiday. It had mixed reviews from reviewers who found it strange. The first printing of The Hunting of the Snark consisted of 10,000 copies. There were two reprintings by the conclusion of the year; in total, the poem was reprinted 17 times between 1876 and 1908. Carroll often denied knowing the meaning behind the poem; however, in an 1896 reply to one letter, he agreed with one interpretation of the poem as an allegory for the search for happiness. Scholars have found various meanings in the poem, among them existential angst, an allegory for tuberculosis, and a mockery of the Tichborne case. The Hunting of the Snark has been alluded to in various works and has been adapted for musicals, opera, plays, and music.","The context explicitly states that the Snark was a Boojum, which explains why the Baker vanishes after claiming to have found it. This indicates that the Snark turned into a Boojum to fool the hunters.",25,1,1,1,1,1,0,4290,560,15.33423113822937,1119570900.2929688

Did the Sun Stand Still?
by 
Brad Bromling, D.Min.
Q.
How can I believe the Bible is reliable when it says that the Sun “stood still” at the request of Joshua?
A.
This question relates to the history narrated in Joshua 10. After the defeat of Ai, five kings of Canaan joined forces to attack the city of Gibeon for making an alliance with Israel. Upon hearing of this move, Joshua and his men marched through the night from Gilgal to Gibeon where, with the Lord's help, Israel waged war. In the midst of battle, Joshua prayed to God that the Sun would stand still until Israel could vanquish her enemy. This request was granted, as the record states: “So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day. And there has been no day like that, before it or after it, that the Lord heeded the voice of man, for the Lord fought for Israel” (Joshua 10:13-14).
Critics insist that such an event is impossible, and thereby impugn the veracity of the Scriptures. Various solutions to this alleged problem have been proposed. This article will consider four of them. First, some suggest that the text should be understood in a figurative sense and that the event did not involve a miracle. Hence, it is suggested that the Lord helped Israel win the battle in such an incredibly short time that she felt as though the day had been lengthened, when in fact it was not (Keil, 1980, 2:110). Second, some scholars take the language figuratively and attach a purely naturalistic explanation to the event. Donald Patten and his colleagues believe that the planet Mars passed by Earth in an unusually close orbit that caused the Earth to tilt on its axis (1973, pp. 172-198). Viewed from the right geographical location, the Sun actually would hang in the sky longer than normal. Third, others suggest that a local miracle took place. Hence, the Sun’s rays may have been refracted miraculously so that they gave every appearance of daylight-illumination in Palestine, when in reality the Sun had slipped below the horizon (Davis, 1980, p. 69). Fourth, still others take the language literally and accept that the Sun was indeed halted miraculously. Henry Morris explains that even more may have been involved: “Since the account says that the moon also stood still (Joshua 10:13), it may be that the entire solar system stopped in its tracks for a day, with all relative positions and motions simply suspended” (1971, p. 73).
Each of these solutions has met with criticism. Against the first it has been contended that a cardinal rule of interpretation is that a passage is to be considered literal until proven figurative. Joshua 10 reads like simple, historical narration. The Lord could have made the day “seem” long, but the text says that “the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the people had revenge upon their enemies” (Joshua 10:13). The second has been challenged for lack of evidence. The notion that the Earth shifted on its axis in response to a fly-by of Mars is purely hypothetical. The third option is rejected out-of-hand by anyone who refuses to accept the possibility of miraculous occurrences. Against the literal reading, it is argued that since the Earth orbits the Sun, it would have been the Earth that ceased to rotate, rather than the Sun stopping, that lengthened the day. Also, if the Earth stopped it would experience incalculable global catastrophes.

Birthplace:
Brooklyn, New York
The son of a Brooklyn policeman who died when he was eight, African-American comedy superstar Eddie Murphy was raised in the comfortable middle-class community of Hempstead, NY, by his mother and stepfather. A natural-born class clown, he was voted the most popular student at Roosevelt Junior and Senior High. By the age of 15, he was doing standup gigs at 25 to 50 dollars a pop, and within a few years he was headlining on the comedy-club circuit.
Murphy was 19 he was when hired as one of the backup performers on the NBC comedy weekly Saturday Night Live. His unique blend of youthful arrogance, sharkish good cheer, underlying rage, and street-smart versatility transformed the comedian into SNL's prime attraction, and soon the country was reverberating with imitations of such choice Murphy characterizations as sourball celebrity Gumby, inner-city kiddie host Mr. Robinson, prison poet Tyrone Green, and the Little Rascals' Buckwheat. Just when it seemed that he couldn't get any more popular, Murphy was hastily added to the cast of Walter Hill's 1982 comedy/melodrama feature film 48 Hours, and voila, an eight-million-dollars-per-picture movie star was born. The actor followed this cinematic triumph with John Landis' Trading Places, a Prince and the Pauper update released during the summer of 1983, the same year that the standup album Eddie Murphy, Comedian won a Grammy. In 1984, he finally had the chance to carry a picture himself: Beverly Hills Cop, one of the most successful pictures of the decade. Proving that at this juncture Murphy could do no wrong, his next starring vehicle, The Golden Child (1986), made a fortune at the box office, despite the fact that the picture itself was less than perfect. After Beverly Hills Cop 2 and his live standup video Eddie Murphy Raw (both 1987), Murphy's popularity and career seemed to be in decline, though his staunchest fans refused to desert him. His esteem rose in the eyes of many with his next project, Coming to America (1987), a reunion with John Landis that allowed him to play an abundance of characters -- some of which he essayed so well that he was utterly unrecognizable.
Murphy bowed as a director, producer, and screenwriter with Harlem Nights (1989), a farce about 1930s black gangsters which had an incredible cast (including Murphy, Richard Pryor, Della Reese, Redd Foxx, Danny Aiello, Jasmine Guy, and Arsenio Hall), but was somewhat destroyed by Murphy's lazy, expletive-ridden script and clichéd plot that felt recycled from Damon Runyon stories. Churned out for Paramount, the picture did hefty box office (in the 60-million-dollar range) despite devastating reviews and reports of audience walkouts. Murphy's box-office triumphs continued into the '90s with a seemingly endless string of blockbusters, such as the Reginald Hudlin-directed political satire The Distinguished Gentleman (1992), that same year's ""player"" comedy Boomerang, and the Landis-directed Beverly Hills Cop III (1994). After an onscreen absence of two years following Cop, Murphy reemerged with a 1996 remake of Jerry Lewis' The Nutty Professor. As directed by Tom Shadyac and produced by the do-no-wrong Brian Grazer, the picture casts Murphy as Dr. Sherman Klump, an obese, klutzy scientist who transforms himself into Buddy Love, a self-obsessed narcissist and a hit with women. As an added surprise, Murphy doubles up his roles as Sherman and Buddy by playing each member of the Klump family (beneath piles and piles of latex). The Nutty Professor grossed dollar one and topped all of Murphy's prior efforts, earning well up into the hundreds of millions and pointing the actor in a more family-friendly direction. His next couple of features, Dr. Dolittle and the animated Mulan (both 1998), were children-oriented affairs, although in 1999 he returned to more mature material with the comedies Life (which he also produced) and Bowfinger; and The PJs, a fairly bawdy claymation sitcom about life in Sout

The U.S. State Department identifies Shining Path as a terrorist organization, but Tupac Amaru hasn't been listed as such since 1999.

Analysts say the group is small in numbers, but it could gain support in rural areas that have been neglected by the Peruvian government. ... The Shining Path began in the late 1960s as a small communist revolutionary group led by a philosophy professor named Abimael Guzmán. Guzmán opposed Peru's prevailing political elites. His followers drew on Marxism and the example of Cuba's Fidel Castro, and coalesced into a significant and violent guerrilla army which regularly used terrorist tactics in their effort to destabilize and overthrow the Peruvian government. At the height of its power, Shining Path's ranks numbered around ten thousand, according to a report from the Jamestown Foundation . A paper from the Council on Hemispheric Affairs (COHA) says the main goal of Shining Path has always been to overthrow the existing Peruvian government and political institutions and replace them with a communist revolutionary command. Guzmán, adopting the nom de guerre Presidente Gonzalo, attempted to do all of this while resisting overt ties with foreign powers or other Latin American leftist groups, including the contemporary Peruvian group known as the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. ...","The context explicitly states that the Shining Path is an effective terrorist organization in Peru and that it operated in various regions of Peru, including Ayacucho, Apurímac, and Huancavelica, as well as in urban areas like Lima.

'Red wine could have led to Jimi Hendrix's death', says close friend Meic Stevens | Daily Mail Online 'Red wine could have led to Jimi Hendrix's death', says close friend Meic Stevens comments 'Jimi Hendrix didn't know how to drink red wine', says close friend Meic Stevens The doctor who attempted to save Jimi Hendrix on the night that the guitarist died said it was 'plausible' he was murdered because he 'drowned in red wine'. But the iconic musician may have choked and died because he did not know how to drink the substance, close friend Meic Stevens has revealed. Speaking publicly for the first time about the night leading to Hendrix's death, the singer-songwriter said the star was mixing red wine with lager and drinking the concoction from a pint glass. He said: ‘I was with Jimi Hendrix the night he died. He had been drinking red wine with me - even though he had never drunk red wine in his life before. The 69-year-old claimed he and Hendrix had been having a night out with Marmalade stars Gary Farr and Jimmy Cregan, as well as Eric Clapton, at the infamous Scotch of St James bar in Mayfair. In an interview for Radio 4 documentary Free Wales Harmony, Mr Stevens claimed Hendrix was intrigued that he was drinking Louis St George Burgundy and wanted to try it. He added: ‘[Hendrix] was drinking lager or some kind of beer and he just poured the wine in to the pint glass. I don’t think he had ever drunk red wine before – he didn’t know how to drink it. ‘But he seemed okay. He seemed to be alright. But the next day I woke up late and somebody phoned and said Jimi’s dead. Apparently he choked on his own vomit. Close friend: Stevens was with Hendrix the night he died and said he was mixing red wine and lager It had long been claimed that Hendrix – one of the best loved guitarists in the history of rock – died aged 27 from choking on vomit after a drugs overdose in 1970. But in 2009, the doctor who attempted to revive him at the now closed St Mary Abbotts Hospital in Kensington admitted it was 'plausible' that he was murdered. John Bannister said that medical evidence was consistent with claims in a book that Hendrix was killed on the orders of his manager, Mike Jeffery. James 'Tappy' Wright, a former road manager who worked for Jeffery, wrote in his memoir Rock Roadie, that in the early hours of September 18, 1970, a gang into the London hotel room where Hendrix was staying with his girlfriend, Monika Dannemann, and forced sleeping pills and wine down his throat until he drowned. Back in the day: Hendrix and Stevens were good friends He claimed Jeffery, beset with debts, had ordered the hit after taking a $2 million insurance policy out on the musician - telling him he was 'worth more dead than alive'. More than she knew? Hendrix with girlfriend Monika Dannemann Wright said Jeffery confessed to him he had ordered the attack before he died in an aircraft collision. Mr Bannister agreed that the description of the murder ""sounded plausible because of the volume of wine”. He said: ‘The amount of wine that was over him was just extraordinary. Not only was it saturated right through his hair and shirt but his lungs and stomach were absolutely full of wine. 'I have never seen so much wine. We had a sucker that you put down into his trachea, the entrance to his lungs and to the whole of the back of his throat. ‘We kept sucking him out and it kept surging and surging. He had already vomited up masses of red wine and I would have thought there was half a bottle of wine in his hair. He had really drowned in a massive amount of red wine.’ Former ice-skating instructor Miss Dannemann committed suicide in 1996 - many fans and conspiracy theorists were convinced she knew more about Hendrix’s death than she ever revealed.

IF you can keep your head when all about you

If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:
If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
' Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,
if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much;

Quotes[ edit ]
I never said, ""I want to be alone."" I only said, ""I want to be let alone! There is all the difference.
Quoted in John Bainbridge, Garbo (1955)
As the Russian ballerina Grusinskaya in Grand Hotel (1932), she had said ""I want to be alone."" These words had become associated with Garbo herself in the public imagination.
I am bewildered by the thousands of strange people who write me letters. They do not know me. Why do they do that?

Allegedly said on a movie set, after a director had filmed repeated takes of Garbo jumping into icy cold water, and wanted to film yet another take. Reported Paul F. Boller, John George, They Never Said It: A Book of Fake Quotes, Misquotes, and Misleading Attributions (1990), p. 30-31.
About Greta Garbo[ edit ]
Every man's harmless fantasy mistress. By being worshiped by the entire world she gave you the feeling that if your imagination had to sin, it can at least congratulate itself on its impeccable taste.
Her instinct, her mastery over the machine, was pure witchcraft. I cannot analyze this woman's acting. I only know that no one else so effectively worked in front of a camera.
Bette Davis , in The Lonely Life : An Autobiography‎ (1962), p. 116
She is the most miraculous blend of personality and sheer dramatic talent that the screen has ever known and her presence in The Painted Veil immediately makes it one of the season's cinema events.
Andre Sennwald, in The New York Times (1934), as quoted in The Films of Greta Garbo (1963) by Michael Conway, Dion McGregor and Mark Ricci, p. 126

Mini Bio (1)
Greta Garbo was born Greta Lovisa Gustafsson on September 18, 1905, in Stockholm, Sweden, to Anna Lovisa (Johansdotter), who worked at a jam factory, and Karl Alfred Gustafsson, a laborer. She was fourteen when her father died, which left the family destitute. Greta was forced to leave school and go to work in a department store. The store used her as a model in its newspaper ads. She had no film aspirations until she appeared in short advertising film at that same department store while she was still a teenager. Erik A. Petschler , a comedy director, saw the film and gave her a small part in his Luffar-Petter (1922). Encouraged by her own performance, she applied for and won a scholarship to a Swedish drama school. While there she appeared in at least one film, En lyckoriddare (1921). Both were small parts, but it was a start. Finally famed Swedish director Mauritz Stiller pulled her from the drama school for the lead role in The Saga of Gösta Berling (1924). At 18 Greta was on a roll.
Following The Joyless Street (1925) both Greta and Stiller were offered contracts with MGM, and her first film for the studio was the American-made Torrent (1926), a silent film in which she didn't have to speak a word of English. After a few more films, including The Temptress (1926), Love (1927) and A Woman of Affairs (1928), Greta starred in Anna Christie (1930) (her first ""talkie""), which not only gave her a powerful screen presence but also garnered her an Academy Award nomination as Best Actress (she didn't win). Later that year she filmed Romance (1930), which was somewhat of a letdown, but she bounced back in 1931, landing another lead role in Mata Hari (1931), which turned out to be a major hit.

Who Was First American Golfer to Win the British Open?
By Brent Kelley
Updated March 05, 2016.
So who was the first American golfer to win the Open Championship ? There are actually two different golfers who qualify as a correct answer to that question, because you can pose the question two different ways:
Who was the first American citizen to win the British Open? Answer: Jock Hutchison.
Who was the first golfer born in the United States to win the British Open? Answer: Walter Hagen .
The answers are different, but the two golfers who are the answers to these questions won their Open Championships in back-to-back years.
First American Citizen to Win the British Open
Jock Hutchison is the golfer who has the distinction of being the first citizen of the United States to win the Open Championship. He did it at the 1921 British Open .
Hutchison was a Scotsman by birth; in fact, he was born in St. Andrews. But he gained American citizenship in 1920. The next year, the Open was played at The Old Course at St. Andrews , and Hutchison returned to his native home to play it.

Good decision! Hutchison won that Open in a playoff over amateur Roger Wethered. Odd twist to the story: Wethered had to be talked into showing up for the playoff. Read our recap of the tournament for more.
First USA-Born Golfer to Win the British Open
Just one year after Hutchison's victory, ""The Haig,"" Walter Hagen, won the 1922 British Open to become the first native-born American winner of the Open Championship. Hagen beat his rival Jim Barnes - they battled frequently in PGA Championships - by one stroke at Royal St. George's Golf Club .
Hagen was born in Rochester, New York. So although he was the first American-born winner, he was also the second consecutive American to win the Open!
In fact, after Arthur Havers' victory in 1923, the next 10 Open champions were all Americans. They included USA-born golfers Hagen, Bobby Jones , Gene Sarazen and Denny Shute ; and golfers who had acquired American citizenship, Barnes and Tommy Armour .","The context explicitly mentions that Walter Hagen was born in Rochester, New York, making him the first US-born winner of the British Open in 1922.

Take The Sky Train
The Sky Train is one of Vancouver’s best transportation bargains. For the price of a DayPass, $9.00, you can ride it the length of its route and return. You can take side trips on the SeaBus to the North Shore or ride as many of Vancouver’s 1000 buses as you can squeeze into the day.
DayPasses are available at the SeaBus station, Sky Train station, Safeway grocery stores, 7/11 convenience stores, Save On Foods and at many London Drugs and Shoppers’ Drug Marts.
The Sky Train is not just a bargain, however. It is one of the best ways to see Vancouver and the surrounding area. From the SkyTrain, you get great views of downtown, neighborhoods and the splendor of the North Shore mountains.
And perhaps, best of all, the SkyTrain’s CanadaLine travels between Vancouver International Airport and downtown Vancouver every 8 minutes at peak hours and every 12 minutes in early morning and evening  for $3.25 per person one way. This 25 minute trip is scenic, fast and worry free. It’s the perfect way to get between downtown Vancouver and the airport.
You can catch the Sky Train at any Sky Train stop, but for this itinerary, we’ll assume you’re picking it up next to Canada Place, at Waterfront Station, which is its terminus.
If you only want to go to the heart of downtown, take the SkyTrain two stops and exit at the Granville Station. That will put you in the heart of downtown Vancouver. You can shop at Pacific Centre Mall or walk a couple of blocks south on Granville to Vancouver’s most fashionable shopping area, Robson Street.
If you want to see some of the attractions outside Vancouver proper, the SkyTrain is an easy way to do it.
For example, you can take the SkyTrain to Metrotown, B.C’s largest shopping complex with over 500 shops and services, 22 cinemas and the Metropolis Entertainment Centre. Metrotown is only eight stops from the Waterfront Station.
Six stops beyond Metrotown is the centre of New West, Columbia Station. It puts you near the Canada Games Pool where you can swim in the Olympic size swimming pool or work out in the fitness centre and training circuit. The facility is open daily from 6:30am-10:30pm. From the SkyTrain, transfer to Bus #102.
You can also visit the West Coast College of Massage Therapy just two blocks west (right) of Columbia Station. WCCMT offers massage therapy as well as herbal and aromatic baths, clay packs, fullbody wraps and salt glow therapy.
Services are provided by advanced students under the supervision of an instructor. The WCCMT is open Monday – Friday 9:00 am to 8:00 PM and Saturday 9:00 am-4:00pm.
From The Columbia Station you are just four stops from completing the entire 39 minute grand tour to the end of the line Surrey’s King George Station.
On your return trip, leave the SkyTrain at the Science World-Main St. Station. From there, pick up an Aquabus or False Creek Ferry for a tour of False Creek. The Aquabus stops at Hornby Street, Granville Island, Yaletown and Science World. Bicycles & dogs are welcome. Ferries operate every day 7 am – 8 PM in winter and 7 am – 10 PM in summer.
To get back to downtown Vancouver after your ferry trip, either get back on the SkyTrain or take the bus, the number of which will depend on where you leave the ferry.","The context mentions that the SkyTrain operates in Vancouver, which is a city in Canada.

Sir Edmund Hillary leads New Zealand party to the Pole
Dogs vs Tractors on Antarctica
On 4 January 1958 Sir Edmund Hillary and his New Zealand party reached the South Pole. They were the first to do so overland since Scott in 1912, and the first to reach it in motor vehicles. The party set out for the Pole after laying food and fuel depots for the British crossing party of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition (TAE). It was an arduous journey – long hours were spent battling through sastrugi (wind-eroded snow ridges), soft snow and dangerous crevasses. But what is often remembered is Hillary's determination to proceed with the journey without the express permission of the TAE, and against the instructions of the committee coordinating New Zealand's contribution.
Discussions with Sir Vivian Fuchs and the Ross Sea Committee
In July 1955, just a month after being appointed to lead the New Zealand component of the TAE, Hillary raised the idea of carrying on to the Pole with the expedition's overall commander, British explorer Dr Vivian Fuchs. At this time neither Fuchs nor the Ross Sea Committee, which was coordinating New Zealand's contribution, raised any objection. But in a series of phone calls and telegrams in early 1957 the Executive of the Ross Sea Committee cautioned Hillary against continuing on to the Pole without Fuchs' express permission. They also knocked back his ambitious plans for the New Zealand parties over the spring and summer. Hillary was surprised, but had not sought the Committee's permission for his activities and so did not see their response as an obstacle. In his autobiography, Nothing venture, nothing win, he commented:
I continued as though the exchange of messages had never occurred ... It was becoming clear to me that a supporting role was not my particular strength. Once we had done all that was asked of us - and a good bit more - I could see no reason why we shouldn't be organising a few interesting challenges for ourselves.
NZ party sets out to lay food and fuel depots
The Pole journey was still firmly in Hillary's mind when the southern party set out from Scott Base on 14 October 1957 to lay food and fuel depots. In November, as the party neared the site of Depot 480, Hillary received another surprising message from the Ross Sea Committee. This time the full Committee had met and indicated that they would give their support to the Pole journey following formal approval from London. Hillary later claimed to have misread the message - taking it that formal approval had already been given.
Geological surveys
Shortly after the party reached Depot 480 Hillary advised the Committee that they intended continuing south towards Fuchs after laying their final depot, Depot 700. If he didn't require their vehicles, they would continue on to the Pole. The Executive Committee instructed him not to leave the final depot unmanned. The party continued on as planned to Depot 700. Shortly after arriving on 15 December they received a message indicating Fuchs would arrive at the Pole between Christmas and the New Year. As the depot neared completion Hillary advised Fuchs and the Committee that his party intended pressing further south to mark a path through the crevassed areas.

Good Fight Ministries - The Spice Girls Good Fight Ministries Support The Spice Girls The Spice Girls took the world of pop by storm as their debut album sold over 20 million copies, and they were catapulted to overnight super stardom and worldwide fame. They have been billed as the ""biggest all girl group of all time"", and their meteoritic rise to fame was said to have only been bypassed by the Beatles before them. So successful and influential was the initial success of the Spice Girls that Pepsi gave them one and a half million dollars to advertise their cola. If the Spice Girls were influencing teens and preteens with Pepsi alone, we would not have to do an exposé on this group. Due to the fact that the Spice Girls are influencing their millions of fans with more than sugar and spice, we deem it necessary to alert both their fans, as well as parents who love their children, about the poison that underlies the candy coating veneer of the Spice Girls. The lyrical content of their songs, as well as their examples as role models, is enough to turn your daughters into tramps just as quickly as the Spice Girls became a sensation. The Spice Girls have put far more time and emotion into their infomercials promoting sexual promiscuity than they have into the array of products they now advertise. The Spice Girls, as you will see, are far from some innocent teeny-bopper group which poses little or no threat on our youth. On the contrary, the fact that they have been packaged and promoted as a bubble gum group with an innocuous message that has deceived many a parent, warrants even greater alarm. Since their audience is largely pre-pubescent, their message becomes all the more unconscionable and needs to be exposed. You should be aware, whether you are a young person or an adult, the Spice Girls are not girls at all, they are fully grown women who are old enough to be the mothers of many of the children they are leading astray.","The context explicitly states that the Spice Girls were given one and a half million dollars by Pepsi to advertise their cola, and that their influence led to people spending money on fizzy drinks to get free CDs, which is tied to Pepsi promotions.

Credit: NASA Neil A. Armstrong was a NASA astronaut and the first man on the moon or, more accurately, the first man to set foot on the moon. He was also an accomplished test pilot and a figure so large in American and world history that you can bet many generations from now people will still be talking about him, as well as his moon landing. Editor's Note: Neil Armstrong died on Aug. 25, 2012. He was 82. One year after his death, NASA recalled the iconic astronaut's legacy in a video tribute. The Truth About Neil Armstrong (Op-Ed) Here are some frequently asked questions about him: Who was Neil Armstrong? He is best known as being the first man to step on the moon (fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin arrived at the moon at the same time, but was the second man to actually set foot on the lunar surface). Since Armstrong was the mission’s pilot, it’s also said that he was the first person to land a craft on the moon. Where was Neil Armstrong from? He was born in Wapakoneta, Ohio, on Aug. 5, 1930. His parents were Stephen Koenig Armstrong and Viola Louise Engel. What mission did Armstrong fly to the moon? Apollo 11 was the name of the first manned lunar landing mission. When was the first moon landing? Apollo 11 touched down on the lunar surface on July 20, 1969. That was more than eight years after President John F. Kennedy gave his historic speech in which he said, “First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth.” Who was the first person in space? Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin orbited Earth on April 12, 1961, giving the Soviet Union a big victory in its Cold War space race against the United States. [ Giant Leaps: Top Milestones of Human Spaceflight ] NASA test pilot Neil Armstrong is seen here next to the X-15 ship #1 after a research flight. Credit: NASA Other facts in the history of Armstrong’s career: Armstrong was a naval aviator from 1949 to 1952. He served in the Korean War. Well before he made spaceflight history, Armstrong got a bachelor of science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Purdue University in 1955 (later, he received a master of science in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Southern California in 1970.) As a NASA test pilot , Armstrong flew the X-15, a rocket-powered, missile-shaped aircraft that tested the limits of high-altitude flight. He flew more than 200 different aircraft, from jets to gliders and even helicopters. Armstrong was the pilot of the Gemini 8 mission, launched March 16, 1966. He performed the first successful docking of two vehicles in space (Gemini 8 docked with a previously launched Agena rocket). After his time as an astronaut, Armstrong was Deputy Associate Administrator for Aeronautics at NASA Headquarters. From 1971-1979, he was Professor of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati. From 1982-1992, Armstrong was chairman of Computing Technologies for Aviation, Inc., Charlottesville, Va. Armstrong largely avoided the public spotlight after his astronaut days. But he remained a vocal supporter of suborbital spaceflight . On the other hand, the former Apollo astronaut was publicly critical of plans to shift the crew-carrying burden in spaceflight from NASA to private spaceships.

Strand asked Zavattini to choose a village with the elusive ""special quality"" he sought. Zavattini knew just such a village: his own birthplace of Luzzara, in the Po Valley. The collaboration of these two remarkable artists resulted in the classic book Un Paese. Published in Italian in 1955, and now available for the first time in the English language, Un Paese captures in photographs and in spoken testimony the essential experience of daily life in Luzzara. It presents a series of intense portraits, graceful landscapes, and images of everyday objects. Paul Strand's photographs are carefully distilled, deeply powerful; they contain the flavors and the rhythms of an entire culture crystallized in a single village. Zavattini successfully synthesizes text and image, aligning with the new cinematic trend of the day, a movement known as Italian neorealism. Their Luzzara is an ordinary village, neither overly picturesque nor greatly unusual, yet it is a town sustained by a grounded humanity and a profound love for the land by its people Tìr a'mhurain : Outer Hebrides by Paul Strand( Book ) 7 editions published between 1962 and 1968 in English and held by 278 WorldCat member libraries worldwide Strand : under the dark cloth by John Walker( Visual ) 5 editions published between 1990 and 2002 in English and held by 224 WorldCat member libraries worldwide [...]","The context explicitly states that Paul Strand was a photographer and filmmaker.

tc_1004,Who had a 60s No 1 with Downtown?,Petula Clark,"Downtown by Petula Clark Songfacts
Songfacts
This was Petula Clark's first hit in the US, which was slow to discover her talents. In the UK, she was a star as a singer and as a television performer, where she was a regular on the BBC. In the early '60s, she also caught on in France when she started recording her songs in French. Oddly, she didn't get an American record deal until late in 1964 when a Warner Bros. executive named Joe Smith, who was vacationing in England, heard the song and signed her to a deal.
When ""Downtown"" was released in the US, it shot to #1, making Petula the first female singer from the UK to hit #1 in the US during the rock era (after 1955). Remarkably, she didn't even promote the song before it hit the top spot, as she was touring French-speaking countries at the time. ""The Ed Sullivan Show had been calling every day while I was on tour in Canada saying, 'You've got to get here,'"" Petula told us. ""I couldn't get there. Eventually I got there, and the record was #1."" (Here's our full Petula Clark interview .)
On the surface, this song is about having a delightful time during a trip downtown. But what happens when the night is over and the singer returns to her everyday life? After all, the trip into the city is merely an escape.
While many listeners don't process the song on this level, Petula does. An accomplished actress, she thinks of her songs as ""mini movies"" when she performs them, and considers the feelings behind them. This song, to her, isn't so chipper. ""I've always thought there was this loneliness and there's even a slight feeling of desperation in it,"" she told us.
A British songwriter and producer named Tony Hatch wrote this. During the '60s, he wrote most of Clark's material, including her follow-up hit ""I Know a Place"" (which also dealt with city life). Hatch was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2013.
Does Petula envision a specific downtown when she performs this song? Here's what she told us: ""It's usually a general image of the sense of getting out and seeing something else. This idea of being alone... I've been there. I have my down days when I'm feeling alone and a bit sorry for myself. And the best thing to do if you can is just to get out there and think about something else and see something else and possibly even talk to someone else - without getting your head bashed in. Not to get too deep into your own solitude and sadness.""
The word ""downtown"" has a different meaning in America than it does in the UK. In America, ""downtown"" is the heart of the city where the action happens. The word isn't used much in Britain, but it generally means the less affluent part of the town's central area. The song's writer, Tony Hatch, used the word in its American meaning as he was inspired by a walk down Broadway during his first visit to New York.
Allan Sherman did a parody of this song called ""Crazy Downtown,"" which went to #40 in the US in August 1965. Sherman's song is about how the parents are elated when their children go downtown, as they finally have some time to themselves at home.
Petula Clark came to record this song at a time when she had carved a successful career in French, Italian and German-speaking territories. She recalled to The Guardian that Tony Hatch suggested she should be recording again in English. ""My head wasn't in it at the time,"" she admitted, ""I was totally into French, Italian, German, whatever. I said: 'Well, you know, if I could find the right song' and he said he had an unfinished song he wanted to play me, and he played 'Downtown' on the piano. I said: 'Woah, I like that.' So I asked him to write a lyric up to the standard of the tune, and two weeks later we did it.""
This won a Grammy in 1965 for Best Rock & Roll Recording, making Clark the first British singer to win a Grammy. In 2003, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. >>

After the words, ""And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you,"" there is the drum roll from Little Peggy March's #1 version of the French tune ""Chariot."" In 1962 Petula had a big continental hit with the same song, which was also known as ""I Will Follow Him.""
Clark recorded a new version of this song for her 2013 album Lost in You, which was released when she was 80 years old.","The context explicitly states that ""Downtown"" was Petula Clark's first hit in the US and reached number one in the 1960s. It also mentions that she was the first female singer from the UK to hit #1 in the US during the rock era after 1955.

""Can't Nobody Hold Me Down"" the debut hit single by rapper Sean ""Puff Daddy"" Combs. It appears on Combs' debut album No Way Out and it was released as the first single in 1997. Combs was already a successful songwriter, producer and record label owner (Bad Boy Records) before he released his debut album as a performer. His first U.S. chart single, ""No Time"", was a top-twenty hit for Lil' Kim on which Puff Daddy was credited as a featured vocalist. ""Can't Nobody Hold Me Down"" was the debut chart appearance for Harlem-based rapper Mase. The song combines elements of several previous singles, the most obvious being a slowed-down rhythm track sampled from Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's ""The Message"". The track's chorus is an interpolation of ""Break My Stride"", a top-five single by Matthew Wilder from 1983. ""Can't Nobody Hold Me Down"" entered the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 at number thirty-two in early 1997 and eventually spent six weeks at number one. It was the beginning of Combs' and Bad Boy Records' chart domination during the year — the Combs-produced ""Hypnotize"" by The Notorious B.I.G. would follow this song at number one, and the B.I.G. tribute song ""I'll Be Missing You"" spent eleven weeks at number one during the summer, only to be followed by another B.I.G. song, ""Mo Money Mo Problems"" and then the Combs-produced ""Honey"" by Mariah Carey.

The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum is a unique  Boston  experience. Entering the beautiful flower-filled courtyard garden leading to the artfully cluttered galleries is like visiting the home of an eccentric great-aunt you didn't know you had. Built to Mrs. Gardner's specifications, almost everything in the museum was placed there by Mrs. Gardner herself when the museum opened in 1903. The result is a fascinating, sometimes frustrating collection of Renaissance, Dutch, Asian and American art, books, manuscripts and decorative arts. The Gardner is also known for its excellent concert and performance series and popular bistro cafe.
Best and worst time to visit the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum
Lines to enter the museum are usually long, but arrive early to mid-morning and you might get at least a few of the galleries to yourself. Afternoon brings crowds and fills up the popular Cafe G. The museum hosts its very popular Third Thursdays from 5-8, featuring music, a cash wine bar and special events in the galleries. Check the museum's calendar for concerts, open studio opportunities and even afternoon yoga classes in the courtyard. Events sell out early, so buy tickets online in advance.
Must see/do at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum
In 1990 the museum was the victim of  one of the great art thefts  in American history. Most of the paintings, including three by Rembrandt, were taken from the Dutch Room on the second floor. There you'll see the empty frames where the missing paintings once hung -- a strangely eerie sight and something you aren't likely to see in any other museum. Downstairs on the first floor, The Blue Room features works of American portrait painter and close friend of Mrs. Gardner, John Singer Sargent. The museum's showpiece and centerpiece of the Titian Room is Titian's masterpiece, Europa. It was purchased by Mrs. Gardner in 1896 for a record-breaking price. Many art historians consider this one of the greatest European paintings on display in the United States.
Admission to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum
The Gardner Museum has a variety of admission programs as well as many discounts and special offers. Admission to the museum averages about $15, with children under 18, members of the U.S. military and their families admitted free. Members of the  Museum of Fine Arts  and visitors who have a ticket stub from the MFA within the previous two days receive a $2 discount. (Likewise, your Gardner ticket will earn you $2 off an MFA admission.) There is also free admission to anyone celebrating a birthday and for everyone named Isabella.
Parking and public transportation to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum
Located in the heart of  the Fenway , the very best way to get to the museum is via subway or the 'T.'
Take either the Green Line E train (make sure you're on an E train outbound toward Heath Street or Arborway, no other Green Line train will get you there) or the 39 bus to the Museum of Fine Arts stop. You'll see the Museum of Fine Arts as you disembark. Cross Huntington Avenue toward the Museum on to Louis Prang Street. The Gardner is two blocks away on your left. If you decide to drive, there is very limited on-street parking and Boston's meter maids are vigilant about ticketing expired meters. There are paid parking lots and garages near the Museum of Fine Arts on Museum Road. Once you've parked, it's a fairly pleasant walk along the Fenway toward Louis Prang Street and the museum.
Food at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum
Housed in the museum's new contemporary wing, Cafe G is a popular dining spot for both museum visitors as well as locals who appreciate the atmosphere as well as the food. The menu consists of seasonal specialties, small plates, main courses and desserts with prices comparable to other Boston-area restaurants. Visitors looking for a quick snack or who are dining on a budget might consider heading back down Huntington Avenue toward the  Prudential Center . Here you'll find a variety of interesting budget-friendly snack options surrounding the campus of nearby  Northeastern University .
Insider tip for visitors to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum
Ask for help. The Gardner Museum galleries are arranged in a style popular in the early 20th century -- paintings are hung practically floor to ceiling with no descriptions attached. To know what you're looking at or to find something you want to look at, spring for the self-guided audio tour or a take a noontime tour with a museum guide.

The Silence of the Lambs: Director
NEXT 
Jonathan Demme.
Jonathan Demme got his start directing Caged Heat (1974), everyone's favorite women-in-prison film. Yes, that's a real genre, women-in-prison, and Caged Heat is the women-in-prisoniest of them all. The movie has ""boobs and blood aplenty,"" yet also features strong female leads.
Hmm. Blood + boobs + strong female lead = the perfect combination to direct The Silence of the Lambs, a film about a man who kidnaps and skins women and the female FBI agent pursuing him. The Silence of the Lambs made Demme a household name and earned him an Academy Award for Best Director. But Demme didn't forget his roots. Roger Corman, who gave Demme his first directed role on Caged Heat, cameos as the FBI director in Lambs. ( Source )
Demme had previously directed Married to the Mob (1988) starring Michelle Pfeiffer, and wanted Pfeiffer to star as Starling in Silence, but she didn't want to be in a film so violent ( source ). So the studio selected Foster, who soon impressed Demme with her presence and her accent.
Demme, Hopkins, Foster, and screenwriter Ted Tally made the perfect team. You'd think they'd all be back for the sequel, Hannibal, almost a decade later. But Demme read the novel and was ""horrified,""  not in a good way. He passed on that project, which was picked up by Ridley Scott ( Alien , Blade Runner ).
Since then, Demme has directed many other films, but only one featuring a sadistic sociopath who just might be a cannibalistic serial killer: Rachel Getting Married (2008) starring Anne Hathaway.","Roger Corman, who gave Jonathan Demme his first directed role on Caged Heat, cameos as the FBI director in The Silence of the Lambs.",24,1,1,1,1,1,0,12791,577,15.029191732406616,1119570900.2929688

Biography of Mr. Fred Astaire
Fred Astaire began his show business career in 1894, at the age of 5, performing on Broadway and in a vaudeville act with his sister, Adele. He soon headed to Hollywood where he and Ginger Rogers formed one of the most iconic dance partnerships in entertainment history.
He then continued his successful partnership with Ginger Rogers for nine movies. By 1976, he had starred in more than 30 musical films with the biggest male and female co-stars of the era, including Joan Crawford, Bing Crosby, Red Skelton, Rita Hayworth, Ann Miller, Debbie Reynolds, Gene Kelly, and Cyd Charisse.
In addition to his expertise as a dancer, Fred Astaire was also an accomplished actor, starring in a variety of dramatic and comedic roles on the big screen and television. His television work earned him multiple Emmys, and he earned an Oscar nomination in 1974 for his role in The Towering Inferno. He received an honorary Academy Award in 1950 for his ""unique artistry and his contributions to the technique of musical pictures.""
With his passing from pneumonia in 1987, we lost a true dancing legend, the likes of which may never be seen again. As Mikhail Baryshnikov observed at the time of his death, ""No dancer can watch Fred Astaire and not know that we all should have been in another business.""
Fred Astaire's Dance Partners
In addition to his legendary work with Ginger Rogers, Fred Astaire also danced with the top leading ladies of his time, including Cyd Charisse, Lucille Bremer, Joan Leslie, Leslie Caron, Vera Ellen, Barrie Chase, Judy Garland, Eleanor Powell and Rita Hayworth.
""For ballroom dancing, remember that your partners have their own distinctive styles also. Cultivate flexibility. Be able to adapt your style to that of your partner. In doing so, you are not surrendering your individuality, but blending it with that of your partner.""
- Fred Astaire from The Fred Astaire Top Hat Dance Album, 1936
Fred Astaire Films
Fred Astaire starred in 31 musical films, including his work with Ginger Rogers in the following films:
Flying Down To Rio (1933)
The Gay Divorcee (1934)

Founded in 1910 just outside of the city limits of Gilbert located in Lanville County, Texas, the Chicken Ranch has for generations been known as the best whorehouse in Texas for its wholesome fun, strict moral code and cleanliness, all perpetuated by its original owner, Miss Wulla Jean. Seven years ago, Miss Wulla Jean passed on, leaving the Chicken Ranch to her favorite working girl, Miss Mona Stangley, who wants to keep the same traditions of Miss Wulla Jean. The Chicken Ranch has always had the unofficial blessing of the local authorities, who see the ranch providing an important community service, one which most in local authority have used at one time or another in their life. In fact, Miss Mona and Lanville County Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd have been in a relationship for years, Ed Earl who is Miss Mona's protector, albeit one with a hot temper and good ol' boy attitude that doesn't exactly match the needs of his law upholding position. That blessing may change when television ... Written by Huggo

See Gustav Klimt's legendary painting ""The Kiss"" as well as major works by Schiele and Kokoschka for yourself. You’ll be delighted by the magnificent ba-roque palace complex and its extensive gardens.
Prince Eugene of Savoy (1663-1736), successful general and art connoisseur, had Belve-dere garden palace built by Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt as his summer residence – at the time it was still outside the gates of the city.
This baroque architectural jewel consists of two palaces (Upper and Lower Belvedere), which today house Austrian art from the Middle Ages to the present day.
Upper Belvedere - world's largest Klimt collection
At the heart of the collections at the Belvedere are the works of Gustav Klimt with his golden paintings ""The Kiss"" and ""Judith"". The masterpieces by Schiele and Kokoschka as well as works of French Impressionism and highlights of the Vienna Biedermeier era (Waldmüller, Amerling, Fendi) that you will see here are every bit as impressive as the paintings of Makart, Boeckl, Wotruba, Hausner, Hundertwasser and others.
Masterworks of late Gothic art like the Znaim Altar, works by Michael Pacher, Rueland Frueauf the Elder and Conrad Laib are also on display here, along with lavish works of art dating from the baroque age. Significant works by Johann Michael Rottmayr, Daniel Gran and Paul Troger give a fascinating insight into the wealth of these times. The grimacing character heads by the sculptor Franz Xaver Messerschmidt are also very emotive.
Lower Belvedere - Prince Eugene’s apartments and staterooms
The feudal splendor of the palace’s aristocratic owner is reflected in the Hall of Grotesques, the Marble Gallery, and the Golden Room. Intriguing special exhibitions are staged in the Lower Belvedere and the Orangery.
Palace stables – Medieval Study Collection
The stables once housed the prince's 12 finest horses: today you will find the Belvedere's entire medieval art collection here.

If Today is Your Birthday November Twenty Sixth
Personality Profile for People Born on November 26
The following descriptions reveal some of the characteristics of people who share a birthday—those who are born on November 26th of any year—based on various methods used in Astrology, Numerology, and Cartomancy. Note that both Astrology and Numerology reveal much more depth when a birth year, and in the case of the former, a birth time and place are included.
The Astrology & Numerology of your Birthday
Your Sun is in Sagittarius in the Sagittarius decanate and quadrant.
The ruler of your Sun in Sagittarius is Jupiter. Jupiter is jovial, optimistic, idealistic, and philosophical. Born in the first decanate, you have a hearty sense of humor and fun, yet you seek to learn about the big picture so that you are not merely fun and games.
Your Sun Sign:
Sagittarius, the Archer
Sagittarius has a lively personality and is an optimist. Considered one of the most fun-loving signs of the zodiac, Sagittarians are direct, forthright, and sometimes completely tactless as they say exactly what they’re thinking! This can be seen as refreshing honesty, or bluntness, depending on the audience. Sagittarius is restless and inquisitive, and often will make quick jaunts impulsively just for a change of scenery. Constantly seeking out something new and stimulating, Sagittarians often have another goal in mind even before they accomplish the first. Sagittarius is naturally questioning and interested in the big picture, and can be quite philosophical or opinionated.
Planet: Jupiter; Element: Fire; Quality: Mutable; Color: Purple; Day: Thursday; Stone: Turquoise; Part of Body Ruled: Liver and hips; Motto: I philosophize; Energy: Yang
Your Personality Profile:
Although you possess considerable common sense, you do question accepted
rules. You are a seeker, yet your feet are on the ground. You want to create
your own destiny, and and bumps and bruises along the way simply contribute to
your growth, and you know it. Your emotions are up and down, although others may
not always see this until they know you well. Your nature is irrepressible, yet
you manage to earn others’ respect at the same time.
Determined – Spunky – Original
Robert Goulet, born November 26, 1933 Singer/Actor.
Tina Turner, born November 26, 1939 Singer.
Rich Little, born November 26, 1938 Comedian.
Charles Schulz, born November 26, 1922 Cartoonist.
Fixed Star(s) Near Your Sun:
Sun Conjunct Acrab
This fixed star has a Mars-Saturn influence, and suggests determinism, some
materialism, patience, and caution. Progress may be slow, and some financial
losses possible. You are adept at research, especially involving the uncovering
of secrets or the solving of mysteries.
Progressed Sun: Turning Points in the Life
We carry our Sun sign with us throughout our entire lives. If I’m a Sagittarius, I’ll always be a Sagittarius. However, in secondary progressions, the Sun “progresses” in a symbolic sense through our natal Sun sign, and then beyond it to subsequent signs. Secondary progressions are “a day for a year”, and because the Sun moves just under one degree per day, our Sun symbolically progresses just short of one degree every year of our lives. Because there are 30 degrees for every sign, if I were born in the latter days of a Sagittarius Sun, my Sun would progress to the sign of Capricorn in my early childhood, and to the sign of Aquarius in my early to mid-30’s. If I were born near the beginning of a Sagittarius Sun, however, my progressed Sun would enter Capricorn close to my 30th birthday, and to Aquarius in my late 50’s. The changeover of signs marks a critical turning point in a person’s life. At the very end of a sign (just before changing signs), individuals may make life-changing, impulsive decisions.
Your progressed Sun enters Capricorn at age 25. The ages of 24 to 26 mark a critical turning point in the development of your personality. You become more practical, mindful, and concerned about your personal security. You are a self-starter, and you become more shrewd and focused on your goals.
Your progressed Sun enters Aquarius at age 55. The ages of 54 to 56 mark a critical turning point in the development of your personality. After some sort of crisis of consciousness, and perhaps elimination of circumstances that have been limiting your growth, you become more humanitarian, somewhat detached, and independent. Some may become self-righteous and fixed during this phase, while others learn to detach themselves from situations and loosen up. You kick up your heels and enjoy life with a certain level of detachment and confidence that you hadn’t discovered before this time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What's your earliest memory of cycling?
Miguel Indurain winning the Tour de France . I was captivated by him winning five Tours in a row. I think I was watching the [1996] Tour on French Eurosport when he was going for a sixth title and he got dropped on the mountain and I remember the commentator shouting 'Indurain lâcher', meaning he'd been dropped.
And your first bike?
I had a Raleigh Chopper.
What's the last film you watched?
The last film I watched was, er … Oh, that one that was weird that had Keira Knightley in it ... you know, the one where they donate their organs ... what's it called? It was a book. You know, it was in a school and it all appeared fairly normal and then you realise ... 'Never Let Me Go', that's it.
Can you remember the first bike race you went to?
I think the first bike race I went to was when I was working for the BBC. I covered the very first international event at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome in Glasgow which was a round of the Track World Cup in 2012. That was the first live cycling event I had been to.
So, why the switch over to cycling?
Well, I always wanted to broaden out and be a general presenter rather than being an expert. Being the anchor is just a general broadcasting skill. I love, I think, all sports and I'm fascinated by them and so I just looked for opportunities to develop career-wise. I really enjoy cycling so when the opportunity came along in 2012 to do that – fortunately it went well – and now I've got a cycling gig with the BBC, I'm now doing the Winter Olympics and did the Paralympics for Channel 4.
For me it's not just about being into athletics and knowing about that sport as a pundit, but also being a broadcaster who can turn his hand to anything.
Are you finding the learning curve a steep one?
Absolutely. Because I have a love of cycling I'm just a sponge for any knowledge, so when I'm with these guys I just pester them for information. Obviously I want to improve my own cycling, I want to understand the sport better so that I can ask intelligent questions.
When we were doing Florence [for the road world championships] last September we had about eight or nine minutes to fill between the end of the men's time trial which Tony Martin won, and the medal presentation. For those moments I need to know what I'm talking about and have a whole reservoir of knowledge because otherwise I'd get to about three minutes and run out of questions. So, fortunately, despite Chris [Boardman] and I scraping the barrel, we did fill the time.
So yes, it's really important to be prepared for those moments when they say 'just keep talking'.
Any on-air cycling faux-pas that you'd care to share with us?

Where Do the Orioles Go from Here?
by August Fagerstrom - July 6, 2016
On June 29, the Baltimore Orioles reached their high-water mark of the season, according to our playoff odds. They’d defeated the San Diego Padres, 12-6 to win their seventh consecutive game, putting them 17 games above .500 with a 5.5-game lead in the division and a 71% chance to make the postseason.
And then the pitching staff happened. It’s been one week since that day, and in that week, little good has come out of the Orioles’ rotation. Baltimore followed up its seven-game winning streak with a five-game losing streak, due largely to the fact that its starting rotation averaged just five innings per start with a 7.46 ERA and 6.74 FIP. Sweeping conclusions aren’t to be drawn from any seven-game stretch, of course; the Cubs’ rotation has been equally underwhelming over the last week and there’s no alarm bells going off there. But unlike in Chicago, what we’ve seen from Baltimore’s starters over the last week only reinforces what we already knew: this Baltimore rotation isn’t very good.
You know the numbers over the last week. Over the last month, it’s still not good, with a 5.52 ERA and a 5.13 FIP. Spanning the whole year, Orioles starters have pitched to a 5.12 ERA and a 4.79 FIP. Starting rotations with an ERA north of 5.00 don’t typically make the postseason. Starting rotations with an ERA north of 5.00 certainly aren’t to be trusted in the postseason, at the very least.
All the same, the Orioles have had that starting rotation all year, and here they are, still in first place, still well above .500, and still possessing roughly a 50% shot of making the playoffs. Those 50/50 teams are interesting, because those 50/50 teams have questions, questions like, in this case: How did they get here ? What does the starting rotation hold? With the trade deadline looming, in what ways could that rotation be improved, and to what extent?
They got here with the bats , and the bats expect to stay . It’s been a top-five lineup thus far, and it projects as a top-five lineup moving forward. They got here with the bullpen , and the bullpen expects to stay . By WPA, Baltimore’s had baseball’s third-best bullpen this year, thanks to Zach Britton taking yet another step forward and Brad Brach cementing himself as one of baseball’s better non-closing relievers. The projections see no reason for the bullpen to fall off any time soon.
But that rotation? It’s been ugly, and it expects to remain ugly . The only teams with worse rest-of-season projections in the rotation are the Brewers, Angels, Royals, Braves, and Reds. Four of those teams are well out of contention — three never had any intentions to compete in the first place — and the fifth is on its way. After a great start to the season, Chris Tillman ‘s got a 4.28 ERA and 5.46 FIP over his last 10 starts, and his season peripherals are back to their typically underwhelming, mid-rotation level. Likewise, Kevin Gausman ‘s mediocre peripherals remain unchanged. Yovani Gallardo has completely crashed and burned, which might’ve been easy to spot in the offseason. Ubaldo Jimenez has been one of the very worst starters in baseball by RA9-WAR, lost his spot, and is only back in the rotation due to Baltimore’s complete lack of depth.
So, there’s the first problem: the projections don’t see much hope. And the bigger issue might be that Baltimore entered the season without much in the way of any backup plans. Dylan Bundy ‘s not ready to be stretched out into a starter role, which leaves guys like Vance Worley , Tyler Wilson , Mike Wright , and Odrisamer Despaigne as the alternatives to Gallardo and Jimenez.","The context mentions the Baltimore Orioles as the team in question, indicating that they come from Baltimore, Maryland.

What is the purpose of the Naismith Legacy Award?
The Naismith Legacy Award is presented to players, coaches and other individuals or organizations from the game of basketball honoring their role in furthering the values of Honor, Respect and Integrity, both on and off the court. The recipients are honored by the NLG at special ceremonies at select Tour locations.
How are the Naismith Legacy Award recipients determined?
Unique among sports honors, most of which are granted annually after a competitive process, the NL Award is given on an ad-hoc basis, meaning not in regular or schedules timeframes. Recipients are nominated by a distinguished NL Nominating Committee, and then selected by the NL Board of Directors and Selection Committee for their role in furthering the values of fun, respect, integrity, honor and teamwork that Dr. Naismith wrote into the “Original Rules.”
What are the details of the Naismith Legacy Award?
The NL Award which stands about 2 ½ feet tall and weighs about 80 pounds features a specially commissioned 3 dimensional sculpture by Michael Roche of Dr. Naismith standing in the YMCA gym during the 1890’s. The work is based on photographs of Dr. Naismith and the YMCA gymnasium where he invented the basketball the winter of 1891. Renowned artist / sculptor Michael Roche, who specializes in highly detailed collectibles, created the sculpture, which bears the inscription: “In Recognition of the Invention of Basketball and a Life Lived with Honor” and a copy of the 13 rules he placed on the bulletin board etched on the back of award. Roche’s work includes some of the most prestigious clients, sports figures and unique artwork for any awards including, “gunslingers” golfers” and movie characters like Wizard of Oz and sports figures like, Old Tom Morris, Newt Rockne and legendary athlete Jim Thorpe.
When presenting the award, we require being included in a current event within the recipient’s organization or town, or a special event built around the presentation itself. The award is financed by the local businesses and organizations who partner in promoting the recipient.
The “Mid-Size” Naismith Legacy Award stands about 14” high, weighs about 10 pounds and is used to honor top volunteers, coaches, officials, donors or sponsors of your organization. Most awards are funded by the organization or a local sponsor who wants to be affiliated with such a prestigious award. We have the award qualification form and nomination form for you to use in the selection process. For example, we have had great success in using this as a “Coach of the Year” award in local high schools and as a year-end award for the coaches in the whole county presented at the year-end banquet. It also works well as a “Volunteer / Sponsor / Donor Appreciation” award.
What is the Doc Naismith Award?
The Doc Naismith Award recipients exemplify the core values the Dr. Naismith lived by and we honor like: respect, teamwork, sportsmanship, honesty, servant hood, integrity and excellence. The award is the “Naismith figure” part of the Naismith Legacy Award and stands about 8” high. The focus of this award honors players, volunteers or coaches. We have the award qualification form and nomination form for you to use in the selection process.

Australia

There have been few long-running Australian-made sitcoms, but many U.S. and UK sitcoms have been successful there. UK sitcoms are a staple of government broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC); in the 1970s and 1980s many UK sitcoms also screened on the Seven Network. By 1986, UK comedies Bless This House and Are You Being Served? had been repeated by ABC Television several times, and were then acquired and screened by the Seven Network, in prime time. 

In 1981, Daily at Dawn was the first Australian comedy series to feature a regular gay character (Terry Bader as journalist Leslie).

Sitcoms started appearing on Indian television in the 1980s, with serials like Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi (1984) and Wagle Ki Duniya (1988) on the state-run Doordarshan channel. Gradually, as private channels were allowed, many more sitcoms followed in the 1990s, such as Zabaan Sambhalke (1993), Shrimaan Shrimati (1995), Office Office (2001), Khichdi (2002), Sarabhai vs Sarabhai (2005) to F.I.R.

Sitcoms on U.S. radio

The 15-minute daily program was revamped in 1928, moved to another station, renamed Amos 'n' Andy, and became one of the most successful sitcoms of the period. It was also one of the earliest examples of radio syndication. Like many radio programs of the time, the two programs continued the American entertainment traditions of vaudeville and the minstrel show.

Sitcoms on U.S. television

1940s–1950s

Mary Kay and Johnny, aired from 1947 to 1950, was the first sitcom broadcast on a network television in the United States and was the first program to show a couple sharing a bed, and the first series to show a woman's pregnancy on television.  

I Love Lucy, which originally ran from 1951 to 1957 on CBS, was the most watched show in the United States in four of its six seasons, and was the first to end its run at the top of the Nielsen ratings (an accomplishment later matched only by The Andy Griffith Show in 1968 and Seinfeld in 1998) . The show is still syndicated in dozens of languages across the world, and remains popular, with an American audience of 40 million each year.  A colorized version of its Christmas episode attracted more than eight million viewers when CBS aired it in prime time in 2013 – 62 years after the show premiered.  A second colorized special, featuring the ""L.A. At Last!"" and ""Lucy and Superman"" episodes, aired on May 17, 2015, attracting 6.4 million viewers.  It is often regarded as one of the greatest and most influential sitcoms in history. In 2012, it was voted the 'Best TV Show of All Time' in a survey conducted by ABC News and People Magazine. 

The Honeymooners debuted as a half-hour series on 1955 and was originally aired on the DuMont network's Cavalcade of Stars and subsequently on the CBS network's The Jackie Gleason Show,  which was filmed in front of a live audience. Although initially a ratings success—becoming the #2 show in the United States during its first season—it faced stiff competition from The Perry Como Show,   and eventually dropped to #19,  ending its production after only 39 episodes (now referred to as the ""Classic 39""). The final episode of The Honeymooners aired on September 22, 1956. Creator/producer Jackie Gleason revived The Honeymooners sporadically until 1978. The Honeymooners was one of the first U.S. television shows to portray working-class married couples in a gritty, non-idyllic manner (the show is set mostly in the Kramdens' kitchen, in a neglected Brooklyn apartment building).Conner (2010), [http://www.usariseup.com/all-about-family/sitcoms-often-reinforce-racial-ethnic-stereotypes Sitcoms Often Reinforce Racial Ethnic Stereotypes]  Steven Sheehan explains the popularity of The Honeymooners as the embodiment of working-class masculinity in the character of Ralph Kramden, and postwar ideals in American society regarding work, housing, consumerism, and consumer satisfaction. The series demonstrated visually the burdens of material obligations and participation in consumer culture, as well as the common use of threats of domestic violence in working class households.  Art Carney won five Emmy Awards for his portrayal of Ed Norton  — two for the original Jackie Gleason Show, one for The Honeymooners, and two for the final version of The Jackie Gleason Show. He was nominated for another two (1957, 1966) but lost. Gleason and Audrey Meadows were both nominated in 1956 for their work on The Honeymooners. Meadows was also nominated for Emmys for her portrayal of Alice Kramden in 1954 and 1957.   In 1997, the episodes ""The $99,000 Answer"" and ""TV or Not TV"" were respectively ranked #6 and #26 on ""TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time""  and in 1999, TV Guide published a list titled ""TV's 100 Greatest Characters Ever!"" Ed Norton was #20, and Ralph Kramden was #2.  In 2002, The Honeymooners was listed at #3 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time and #13 on their list of the ""60 Greatest Shows of All Time"" in 2013. 

1960s

The Andy Griffith Show, first televised on CBS between 1960 and 1968, was consistently placed in the top ten during its run.  The show is one of only three shows to have its final season be the number one ranked show on television, the other two being I Love Lucy and Seinfeld. In 1998, more than 5 million people a day watched the show's re-runs on 120 stations. 

The Dick Van Dyke Show, initially aired on CBS from 1961 to 1966, won 15 Emmy Awards. In 1997, the episodes ""Coast-to-Coast Big Mouth"" and ""It May Look Like a Walnut"" were ranked at 8 and 15 respectively on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time.  In 2002, it was ranked at 13 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time  and in 2013, it was ranked at 20 on their list of the 60 Best Series.

Definition of Sitcom in the 21st century

Modern critics have disagreed over the utility of the term ""sitcom"" in classifying shows that have come into existence since the turn of the century, including whether or not cartoons can be sitcoms.","The context mentions that ""Amos 'n' Andy"" was one of the earliest examples of radio syndication, which implies its international reach, including Britain.

What's unusual about this one is that the prime-time show it's based on is, itself, based on an earlier cartoon. The Addams Family came out of a series of panels by Charles Addams, which ran in The New Yorker for several decades, starting in 1937. The sitcom, which originally aired from 1964-66, was proving popular in syndicated reruns. Like I Dream of Jeannie and Batman, its characters were licensed by the Hanna-Barbera studio to guest-star on what was then their leading show, Scooby-Doo. The Scooby/Addams crossover appeared in 1972, and made such a hit, Hanna-Barbera produced a regular half-hour Addams Family Saturday morning series. The series debuted September 8, 1973, on NBC. Sanitized and satmornized, this series bore only a superficial resemblance to the creations of Charles Addams. It kept to the general theme of ghoulishness, but here, the macabre elements seemed more like a schtick than an outward expression of truly twisted souls. Their creepy old Victorian mansion was remodeled into a creepy old Victorian mansion-like vehicle, in which they traversed the land, getting involved in the lives of various people they met. And of course they had pets — tho at least they opted for an octopus rather than a puppy, and their cat was considerably larger and more obviously carnivorous than most. Lennie Weinrib ( Inch High, Private Eye; various voices in Smurfs ) provided the voice of Gomez Addams, and Janet Waldo ( Penelope Pitstop, Judy Jetson ) did that of Morticia. Jackie Coogan and Ted Cassidy repeated their roles from the live-action version. Another notable voice credit was Jodie Foster as Pugsley. This series lasted all of 13 episodes, each of which was aired over and over during the two years the network carried it. It's been re-run from time to time, most recently on Cartoon Network. It also spawned a comic book version, published by Gold Key, which began with an October, 1974 cover date and ended with #3, dated April, 1975. Hanna-Barbera produced a second Addams Family series, 1992-93, this one lasting 16 episodes. It resembled the original a little more closely, but with parent action groups still wielding some of their old power, still wasn't able to delve into the characters' true weirdness. Voice actors in this one included John Astin reprising his 1960s role as Gomez, with Nancy Linari (several voices in Sonic the Hedgehog and Duckman ) as Morticia, Jim Cummings ( Darkwing Duck, Tasmanian Devil ) as Lurch and Carol Channing ( Mehitabel, several voices in Where's Waldo?) as Granny. As robust as the Addams Family franchise is in live action — two TV series, a special, three movies, and endless syndicated reruns over a period of nearly four decades — both animated versions seem rather puny and insipid. The only cartoons that ever truly depicted The Addams Family are the ones drawn by Charles Addams himself. — DDM The Addams Family – EW.com Horror, Comedy We gave it a D+ In The Addams Family, these animated Addamses look and sound familiar — John Astin even does the voice of Gomez — but they completely lack the macabre charm of previous TV and movie versions. (In 1973, Hanna-Barbera produced a TV-cartoon Addams Family who were even more charmless than this.) In this new incarnation, the creepy family is drawn in bright colors, giving them an inappropriately perky look. Their spooky spirit is definitely missing; all that’s left is sadomasochistic sight gags and grossness worthy of the Garbage Pail Kids. For example, Fester blows his nose and says, ”I’ll save that for my collection.” Tune in to reruns of the original series or rent the movie on video instead.

Keep reading to find out more about the history of Nobel Peace Prizes here at the White House. What’s the Nobel Peace Prize? Alfred Nobel was a man of many disciplines -- including science, invention, entrepreneurship, literature, and peace. When he passed away in 1896, he dedicated his will to award those who have been outstanding figures in these fields. As a result, in 1900, the Nobel Foundation was established and became the organization responsible for awarding the Nobel Prizes. According to Alfred Nobel’s will, the Nobel Peace Prize shall be awarded to those who have “done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses."" The Nobel Peace Prize is an international award that is awarded every year by the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The prize ceremony takes place annually on December 10, the date on which Alfred Nobel passed away. The prize usually includes a medal, personal diploma, and award money. Woodrow Wilson's Nobel Peace Prize Medal. Picture provided by the Library of Congress. Which Presidents and Vice Presidents have won a Nobel Prize? Our story starts in 1906 when Theodore Roosevelt became the first President to win a Nobel Peace Prize. Since then, three other Presidents and one Vice President have received the honor. Below is a list of recipients from the White House: President Woodrow Wilson in 1920, for his efforts in ending the First World War and help in creating the League of Nations. President Jimmy Carter in 2002, for his efforts in finding “peaceful solutions to international conflicts, advancing democracy and human rights, and promoting economic and social development.” Vice President Al Gore in 2007, for his efforts to obtain and spread knowledge about climate change. President Barack Obama in 2009, for his efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation. When President Obama accepted the prestigious award in 2009, he humbly highlighted his surprise in receiving the honor: I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the considerable controversy that your generous decision has generated. In part, this is because I am at the beginning, and not the end, of my labors on the world stage.

Historic Roots
Jackie Joyner-Kersee was born Jacqueline Joyner to parents Mary and Alfred Joyner on March 3, 1962. Jackie recalls in her autobiography that at the time she was born, John Kennedy was president and her paternal grandmother stated to her mother, ""if it's a girl, name her Jacqueline because she'll be the first lady of something"" (Joyner-Kersee and Steptoe 1997, 12). Jackie's grandmother was speaking a prophetic word that would be realized in her life.
In her autobiography, Joyner-Kersee describes humble beginnings. Jackie's parents were very young when they married. Her mother, Mary, was sixteen when Jackie's older brother Al was born. She was eighteen when she gave birth to Jackie. Jackie, her parents, paternal grandmother, and three siblings shared a home in East St. Louis, Illinois. Sometimes, in the winter the furnace would break down and Jackie's parents would heat the house with the oven. Another casualty of winter was the water pipes bursting. Jackie and her family saved jugs of water in the event of this happening and they heated the water on the stove to bathe and wash dishes (Joyner-Kersee and Steptoe 1997). Jackie grew up in a neighborhood that had strong community ties yet was plagued with violence. Her parents did their best to shelter and protect their family (Ibid.).

ESPN.com: Sampras competes against best -- ever Sampras competes against best -- ever By Larry Schwartz His opponents aren't Agassi, Rafter and Rios. They are Laver, Rosewall and Emerson. Pete Sampras isn't playing for today; he's competing for history. Pete Sampras needs to win on the clay of the French Open to be considered the best ever. When he won his sixth Wimbledon championship in 1999, it gave him 12 Grand Slam singles titles, tying Roy Emerson ior most majors all time. Though he had earned more than $35 million in ATP Tour earnings going into 1999, it is Grand Slams that consume him. The easy-going, hard-hitting Sampras would trade a dozen of his 55 Tour victories (through 1998) for one French Open or another Australian. Let others play for money; he's playing for majors. ""I measure my year on how I do at the majors and the more that I have won over the years, the more I want to win,"" Sampras said. ""I don't look at myself as a historical icon, but the reality of it is, yeah, I am playing for history now."" Sampras, 27, is not the indifferent jock he pretends to be. While he gives the impression that he doesn't play with a passion, he deeply wants to be remembered as the best ever. ""I don't think it's arrogant,"" Sampras said. ""I'm not ashamed that I feel that I can actually do it."" Yet, he is uncomfortable in the spotlight. He is a throwback to the days when gentleman played the sport of tennis. ""I could be a jerk and get a lot more publicity, but that's not who I am,"" said Sampras, who believes in the past, but came of age in the 1990s. Although Sampras is tied with Emerson for the Slams record, he was taught to emulate Rod Laver, the winner of two Grand Slams, 11 majors, and generally regarded as the game's greatest. ""There wasn't an American that I really idolized,"" Sampras said. ""Sure, I respected (John) McEnroe's talent and (Jimmy) Connors' intensity, but the Aussies, those guys were great guys."" And the players he admired most were the gentlemanly Laver and Ken Rosewall. Since 1993, when he first claimed the No. 1 ranking, the 6-foot-1 Sampras has stood head and shoulders above his playing opponents. While he has a ferocious forehand and sensational serve, his greatest gift may be his will to win. He's not afraid to leave his guts on the courts -- literally. He was born Aug. 12, 1971 in Washington, D.C., and grew up in Palos Verdes, Cal. His father, Soterios, called Sam, was an aerospace engineer for the Department of Defense and his mother, Georgia, was a homemaker. He began playing tennis at seven and when he was nine, his father asked Pete Fischer, a physician and amateur player, to hit with his son. Fischer was so impressed with the youngster's ability, he became his coach. When Sampras was 11, he had the opportunity to trade groundstrokes with Laver, his idol. ""Pete was so nervous he couldn't get the ball over the net,"" Fischer said. Sampras rarely won a major junior tournament. Fischer believed his protege needed to play ""up"" in age groups, against stronger and older players to develop his all-around game. ""From the very beginning, the competition was always Laver,"" Sampras said. At 14, Fischer changed Sampras' backhand from two-handed to one-handed. He also switched him from a safe defensive baseliner to a classic risky serve-and-volleyer. ""I played just like (Michael) Chang, grinding from the baseline,"" Sampras said. ""When I started serving and volleying, I became much more laid back."" Fischer told him that someday these changes would help him win Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.","Pete Sampras won 14 Grand Slam singles titles, including seven Wimbledon titles, five U.S. Open titles, and two Australian Open titles. However, the context explicitly states that he never won the French Open, which is the only Grand Slam tournament he did not win in the 20th century.",42,1,1,1,1,1,0,27589,1318,39.46548247337341,1119570900.2929688

He also won seven gold medals at the canoeing world championships and 71 individual and team titles in the Swedish championships. Born Nov. 21, 1919, Fredriksson started canoeing as a youth.

By John Coon   |   Monday, 13 Apr 2015 12:05 PM Close     A   A   Ohio could be a major player beyond the ballot box alone in 2016. The biggest cities in Ohio, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Columbus, are all making a push to lure the GOP Party to present its 2016 presidential candidate there. Cleveland and Columbus also competed for the chance to host the 2016 Democratic convention before Philadelphia landed it. If they succeed, it means that these cities will earn a greater share of the spotlight in 2015 and 2016. Here are some things you need to know about them and how they help define the identity of the Buckeye State: VOTE NOW: Is Ohio Gov. John Kasich Doing a Good Job? 1. Columbus: The Arch City is the state capital and also Ohio's most heavily populated city. It is the third largest Midwestern city in the United States with a population of 822,553 according to 2013 estimates. Columbus is home to the Ohio State University, which is the state's flagship institution of higher education. It is also a noted hub for independent art. 2. Cleveland: On the shores of Lake Erie, Cleveland is a destination for legions of music lovers. It houses the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, a museum that showcases the history of that music genre along with notable past and present rock and roll musicians. Cleveland is also the birthplace of Standard Oil. John D. Rockefeller founded his company there in 1870. It has remained an important manufacturing center since that time. 3. Cincinnati: The third largest city in Ohio was the first American city founded after the Revolutionary War, in 1788. Less than a century later, it earned the distinction of being the first place to establish a pro baseball team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, in 1869. Cincinnati was once known as the Paris of America because of historic architecture dating back to the 1800s. VOTE NOW: Should the Government Be Doing More to Promote Tourism in America? 4. Toledo: The Glass City earned its namesake after it emerged as the center of the glass industry in the early 20th century. Many large glass companies started in Toledo and the Toledo Museum of Art houses a collection of all different types of glass. The city became iconic in popular culture as a result of the TV Series M*A*S*H* in the 1970s and early 1980s. Corporal Maxwell Klinger, played by actor Jaime Farr, was a Toledo resident in the series before being drafted into the Korean War. 5. Akron: Much like the glass industry defined Toledo, the rubber industry has defined Akron. Ohio's fifth largest city became the Rubber Capital of the World in the early 20th century after several large tire companies set up headquarters and opened manufacturing plants within the city. Akron has had an influence on what people eat for breakfast as well as transportation. The forerunner to the Quaker Oats Company, F. Schumacher Milling Company, was founded in Akron in the 1880s.

The city also hosts several annual events, including First Night Columbus, the Jazz and Rib Fest and the Arnold Classic, a body-building competition.

Anne Bancroft was born in 1931 in ... it was Bancroft who got the call from 20th Century Fox offering a $ ... Throughout that decade she broke her tradition of ... Anne Bancroft | Film | The Guardian Anne Bancroft Wednesday 8 June 2005 07.09 EDT First published on Wednesday 8 June 2005 07.09 EDT Close This article is 11 years old After a youthful flirtation with television, a near-disastrous relationship with Hollywood and a failed marriage, the actor Anne Bancroft, who has died aged 73, fled the west coast and returned home to New York. It was 1959 and in her own words ""life was a shambles ... I was terribly immature. I was going steadily downhill in terms of self-respect and dignity"". She needed to reclaim her life and career. Happily, it worked and within three years she had won Tonys for her Broadway roles in Two for the Seesaw and as Annie Sullivan in The Miracle Worker. When the latter was transferred to the screen by its author William Gibson and director Arthur Penn, she again took the demanding role of Helen Keller's teacher, winning the best actress Oscar in 1963. This success relaunched her career, leading to prestige roles in the theatre including Mother Courage, Sister Jeanne in The Devils and Regina Giddens in The Little Foxes. There were film roles too, in The Pumpkin Eater (1964) and, most famously, as the seductive Mrs Robinson in the modish and popular The Graduate (1967). This movie, in which Dustin Hoffman made his screen debut, became so closely associated with Bancroft as a 1960s archetype that it somewhat obscured her subsequent career. She was also famously married to the Jewish actor-director Mel Brooks whose mother, told that he was going to marry an Italian-American Catholic, replied ""bring the girl over, I'll be in the kitchen - with my head in the oven"". Despite these and other comments about a mis-match, the marriage proved one of the most stable in show business. It was also creative, and Brooks served as executive producer on movies in which Bancroft excelled, including The Elephant Man (1980) and the two-hander 84 Charing Cross Road (1986). These and other films made for his own company redeemed his often frantic comedies, three of which involved Bancroft. In Silent Movie (1976) she - among other stars - glamorously played herself as a highlight of the film. Sadly, she was less well served when co-starring opposite Brooks in his lumpen remake of the Ernst Lubitsch classic To Be or Not to Be (1983) and by her cameo appearance in his dire spoof Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995). Bancroft was born in the Bronx to a working class family. It was the height of the depression, but even when her father became unemployed in the late 1930s, Anna was allowed tap dancing lessons, then enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Her graduation piece was seen by the actress Frances Fuller, who recommended the 18 year old for television work. Bancroft debuted as Anne Marno in The Torrents of Spring and when a popular radio show The Goldbergs transferred to television she became a member of the TV family, working steadily for two years. Having helped a fellow actor with a screen test, it was Bancroft who got the call from 20th Century Fox offering a $20,000-a-year contract. It was to prove a mixed blessing. Under her new name Anne Bancroft she made her movie debut in Don't Bother to Knock, made in 1952 but held up for a year. Within five years she made 15 films, as various as Demetrius and the Gladiators, a baseball movie The Kid from Left Field and Gorilla at Large (1954). There were several routine westerns, modest thrillers including Jacques Tourneur's Nightfall, plus the dismal The Girl in Black Silk Stockings (1957). By this time she admitted to over indulging in alcohol and being unhappily married to someone ""who calls himself an actor but whose real occupation is playing a rich boy"". She was also in psychoanalysis. The road back involved work with a vocal coach, regular attendance at The Actors Studio and study with Herbert Berghof. Plus three sessions a week with her therapist. Then came a triumphant return to acting, playing first opposite a difficult Henry Fonda, followed by the explosive and physically demanding role in The Miracle Worker. When the film version was announced, the backers wanted either Elizabeth Taylor or Audrey Hepburn, but Penn refused and budgeted it at only $500,000, shooting in New Jersey. At 31 Bancroft became an Oscar winner and in the words of one critic, ""she left Hollywood a failure and returned a star"".","The context explicitly states that Anne Bancroft was born in 1931, which falls within the 1930s decade of the 20th century.",20,1,1,1,1,1,0,6804,1193,27.96381449699402,1119570900.2929688

Suez Canal - Connects the Mediterranean sea to the Red sea
Suez Canal is the largest man-made artificial sea-level waterway found in Egypt. It was opened in the 1869 to allow water transportation between Europe and Asia to avoid ships navigation around Africa. The canal original size was 164 km long and 8metre deep. However enlargements have been undertaken and it now has a length of 193.30 km and its 24 metres deep. It also has a northern access channel of 22 km and 9 km southern access. The canal has a northern terminus known as Port Said and a southern terminus called Port Tewfik.
Suez Canal is owned and maintained by the Suez Canal Authority of the Arab Republic of Egypt. A treaty signed under the International Treaty Act shows that the canal can be used in times of war or peace by every vessel of commerce or of war and no flag is required for distinction. The canal allows passage of ships up to 20 metres and with weight of 240,000 tons. The height allowed above water is a maximum of 68 metres. Big ships offload their cargo to canal- owned boats to reduce their weight and reload later at the end of the canal.
Suez Canal attracts a lot of visitors who come to see the amazing wonders of this man made sea. It serves as the first salt water passage between the Mediterranean and Red Seas. The canal has attracted attention from film makers. A film known as Suez was made in 1938 and it's based on the canal's history. Also in the novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne, a character known as Nautilus travels through an underwater passage beneath the Suez Canal. All these highlight the canal as a very import part in opening up Africa to other parts of the world.

Suez Canal Construction History
Although the Suez Canal wasn't officially completed until 1869, there is a long history of interest in connecting both the Nile River in Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. It is believed that the first canal in the area was constructed between the Nile River delta and the Red Sea in the 13th Century B.C.E. During the 1,000 years following its construction, the original canal was neglected and its use finally stopped in the 8th Century.
The first modern attempts to build a canal came in the late 1700s when Napoleon Bonaparte conducted an expedition to Egypt. He believed that building a French controlled canal on the Isthmus of Suez would cause trade problems for the British as they would either have to pay dues to France or continue sending goods over land or around the southern part of Africa.

Princess Diana's dresses for sale 02:21
Story highlights
Dress worn by Diana to dance with John Travolta sells for $362,424
A total of 10 dresses owned by the late Princess of Wales sells for $1.2 million
Outfits were worn at state occasions, on official visits and for portraits
Entire collection was auctioned in London
Sumptuous velvet, delicate sequins, intricate beading: They are dresses fit for a princess -- Princess Diana, that is -- and if you've got a big pocketbook (with a designer label, naturally), they could have been yours.
Ten dresses worn by the late Princess of Wales went under the hammer at Kerry Taylor Auctions in London on Tuesday.
The top seller was the midnight blue number Diana famously wore to dance with John Travolta at a gala dinner at the White House in November 1985. That dress sold for $362,424 (240,000 British pounds) and was bought by ""a British gentleman as a surprise to cheer up his wife,"" the auction house said.
The entire collection fetched $1.2 million (800,000 British pounds), the auctioneer said.
TV footage and photographs of the princess and the Hollywood star gliding around the room to the music of ""Saturday Night Fever"" were seen around the world, and Travolta later described the experience as having been ""like a fairy tale.""
Diana also wore the ""Travolta"" dress, designed by Victor Edelstein , for her final portrait by Lord Snowdon in 1997.
Auctioneer Kerry Taylor told CNN before the auction that putting a price on such items was ""difficult,"" but that their high profile added value.
Rare photo of teenage Diana sold for $18,369
""You can look at what they sold for, you can look at how simple the thing is,"" she explained. ""If it was worn on a state occasion, or if it was for a private dinner, are there photographs of the princess wearing it, are there film reels of the princess wearing it, and is there a human story that adds to it?""
For example, as Taylor pointed out, a bottle green velvet evening dress, also by Victor Edelstein, bears what could be the traces of a young prince: ""what looks like a little boy's (or little child's) handprint -- sticky fingerprints on the fabric."" The dress sold for $36,281, including the buyer's premium.
Also included in the sale were dresses by some of Diana's other favorite designers. Six werer by Catherine Walker , including the beaded black dress Diana wore for Vanity Fair 's 1997 photoshoot by Mario Testino -- that sold for $163,264 -- and the black Bruce Oldfield gown she wore to the gala opening of ""Les Miserables"" in October 1985 and for another official portrait by Snowdon. That dress sold for $76,190.
The outfits were originally sold in a charity auction at Christie's in New York in June 1997, just months before Diana's death in a Paris car crash in August of that year. Kerry says that despite the passing of the years, the princess remains hugely popular.
""Diana was different,"" she said. ""She was very much a 'people's princess' and the ups and downs of her life, her loves, people followed them avidly. I think there will always be a special place in people's hearts for Diana.""
Taylor also auctioned off the skimpy mesh dress worn by the Duchess of Cambridge -- then known as Kate Middleton -- during a fashion show at the University of St. Andrews, at which she is reputed to have attracted the attentions of her future husband, Prince William.","The context explicitly mentions that the midnight blue dress Diana wore to dance with John Travolta, which sold for the highest amount at the auction, was designed by Victor Edelstein. This is directly stated in the passage, confirming the answer.",35,1,1,1,1,1,0,11740,1050,24.869433403015137,1096047594.7265625

BBC News | World | Spencers agree �2m divorce settlement Wednesday, December 3, 1997 Published at 15:54 GMT World Spencers agree �2m divorce settlement Earl Spencer told court there was no hope of any reconciliation in the marriage The final chapter in the turbulent eight-year marriage of Earl and Countess Spencer has closed after the pair divorced in a South African courtroom. The Countess will receive a lump sum settlement of �1,815,000 by February 1998, according to court documents, a house in Cape Town and joint custody of their four children, plus maintenance payments. Charles Spencer will make up any shortfall between the price of the pair's house and �250,000, in the event of his wife emigrating from South Africa and selling the property. The guarantee takes the total settlement past �2m. The Spencers also undertook not to give any details of their married life, private life or financial affairs to the media. The final order was granted by Mr Justice Farlam at the end of a six-minute hearing in which Earl Spencer admitted his marriage had irretrievably broken down. It follows an announcement on Monday by Earl Spencer, 33, and his 32-year-old estranged wife that they had reached an undisclosed financial settlement. Both parties agreed to withdraw allegations made against each other during last week's acrimonious battle to decide whether the case ought to be heard in South Africa or Britain. 'It's so broken down' During the short hearing, the brother of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, was asked if there was any hope of a reconciliation. The Earl replied: ""There is not, my lord."" And when he was asked if the marriage had irretrievably broken down, he said: ""It's so broken down, my lord."" The judge then agreed to the ending of the marriage after Lady Spencer's legal team made no representations. She was not in court for the hearing. He then left the court and the Earl and his legal team walked through the corridors of Cape Town's High Court into the bright sunshine, where they were followed by waiting photographers. Countess Spencer was not in court to hear the divorce settlement But he walked straight into his lawyer's chambers 100 yards up the road without commenting. Attention is now likely to focus on whether either of them will re-marry as Cape Town pharmacist Guy Woods is reported to have already proposed to Lady Spencer. On the eve of the final settlement, the Earl appeared with his latest girlfriend Josie Borain at a fashion dinner in Cape Town. He had contested Lady Spencer's demands for a clean break settlement of �3.75m despite having a personal fortune of �6m and annual pre-tax income of �1m. The Earl's legal team said his fortune was tied up in the Althorp Estate and family estates in Guernsey and London. Marriage soon in trouble The settlement was reached just before Lady Spencer, her father John, and the Earl's former mistress Chantal Collopy, 37, were due to give evidence against him. The hearing ended the often bitter courtroom battle which revealed lurid details about the couple's private lives. When the couple married in 1989, the prospects seemed rosy for Lord Spencer and Victoria Lockwood, an international model. But the marriage was soon in trouble and the Earl resumed an affair with cartoonist Sally-Ann Lasson within months of his marriage. Move was temporary Despite the birth of their four children, the situation worsened and Lady Spencer, was finding it difficult to cope and went to a Surrey clinic for treatment for anorexia and alcoholism. The couple split in May 1995 and moved to South Africa just before Christmas with the Earl saying a prime reason was to avoid media intrusion. They both said they intended to return to Britain in the future, the Earl because the Althorp ancestral home needed his ""permanent presence"", and Lady Spencer because she said it was always intended as a temporary move.","The context explicitly states that the final chapter of the marriage was closed after the pair divorced in a South African courtroom. It also mentions the final order was granted by a South African judge and that the case was heard in South Africa, not Britain. This directly answers the question about the country where the acrimonious divorce settlement was heard.",37,1,1,1,1,1,0,7665,1196,26.842103481292725,1110957020.5078125

Mohamed Al-Fayed, the former owner of Harrods, ... - LONDON: Mohamed Al-Fayed, the former owner ... called the endorsements a ""curse"" on the luxury department store. Al-Fayed sells London icon store, Harrods to another Arab family for £1.5bn | African News - Nigeria News - African Politics Twitter Mohammed al Fayed Harrods, the world famous department store, has been sold for more than £1.5bn to the Qatari royal family, Times Online can confirm. Mohamed al-Fayed, the Egyptian owner of the London landmark, has decided to retire and will hand over the reins to Qatar Holding. The firm was chosen because they would “maintain the traditions of Harrods”, said Ken Costa, chairman of Lazard International – the investment bank advising the family entrusted with the deal. Fayed received advances from Gulf-based suitors in the last two months, but initially offered them “two fingers” in a vehement refusal. “People approach us from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar. Fair enough, but I put two fingers up to them all,” Fayed said last month. “It is not for sale. This is not Marks & Spencer or Sainsbury. It is a special place that gives people pleasure. There is only one Mecca.” But today Costa confirmed that the owner of Fulham football club has changed his mind. “After 25 years as chairman of Harrods, Mohamed al-Fayed has decided to retire and to spend more time with his children and grandchildren,” Costa said. Costa said Fayed’s family trust agreed to sell because Qatar Holding had “both the vision and financial capacity” to support the long-term growth of Harrods. Fayed “wished to ensure that the legacy and traditions that he has built up in Harrods would be continued”, he added. The Egyptian has invested around £400m in the Knightsbridge icon to restore it to its former glory, including £75m for an Egyptian-themed escalator flanked by sphinxes. Qatar Holding, which handles investments for the Middle Eastern state’s royals, will become only the fifth owner of Harrods since its creation in 1840. The store has  been owned by the Egyptian tycoon since 1985’, is thought to have changed hands in a secret deal with Gulf-based investment group Qatar Holding, which is owned by the Qatari royal family. Sources speaking to Sky News said the department store had sold for £1.5 billion. It comes after it emerged that Mr al Fayed had received an unsolicited approach for Harrods in March. At the time Mr al Fayed, who also owns Fulham Football Club, tried to reassure staff that the store in London’s Knightsbridge area was not for sale. Harrods, which is one of the world’s most famous stores and extends over seven floors, sees more than 15 million customers pass through its doors each year. Harrods was bought by Fayed in 1985 for £615 million. The retailer has been regularly linked to takeover speculation . In 2002 John Ritblat, then-chairman of British Land, offered to buy Harrods from Mr Fayed and lease it back to him. However the offer was rejected by Mr Fayed, who told Ritblat – who was knighted in 2006 – that the store was not for sale. In 2003, it was suggested that Mr Fayed wanted to put the store on the market. It was linked to Harvey Nichols’ owner Dickson Poon and investment bank Lazards, which was reported to be working on a deal to merge Harrods with Selfridges, the rival department store. A spokesman for Harrods was not immediately available to comment on the reports that the store had now been sold, but a statement is expected to be made on Saturday confirming the deal. Ken Costa, the chairman of Lazard International, the investment bank advising the deal, confirmed the sale to Sky News. In a statement he said: “After 25 years as chairman of Harrods, Mohamed al-Fayed has decided to retire and to spend more time with his children and grandchildren. He has built Harrods into a unique luxury brand with worldwide recognition. In reaching the decision to retire, he wishes to ensure that the legacy and traditions that he has built up in Harrods would be continued, and that the team that he has built up would be encouraged to develop the foundations that he has laid. Qatar Holding (QH) will become only the fifth owner of Harrods since its creation, in 1840. Qatar Holding was specifically chosen by the Trust as they had both the vision and financial capacity to support the long-term successful growth of Harrods. Of paramount importance to Mohamed al-Fayed was to ensure that the Harrods staff would find in QH an owner who would be supportive of their efforts to maintain the traditions of Harrods.” Sources: Telegraph /Times Al-Fayed says he torched Harrods royal warrants - Daily News Egypt Al-Fayed says he torched Harrods royal warrants - Daily News Egypt Thursday January 19, 2017 Jobzella Email Al-Fayed says he torched Harrods royal warrants LONDON: Mohamed Al-Fayed, the former owner of Harrods, said Sunday he had the plush London emporium’s royal warrants taken down and burned. The Egyptian tycoon, in a letter to The Sunday Telegraph newspaper, called the endorsements a ""curse"" on the luxury department store. A royal warrant allows a supplier to advertise that they are used by the royal family. The Harrods warrants were from Queen Elizabeth II, her husband Prince Philip, queen Elizabeth the queen mother and Prince Charles. ""I ordered their removal. Later, I had them burned. They were a curse and business tripled following their removal,"" Al-Fayed said. The royal warrants were removed from Harrods in 2000. Al-Fayed has consistently attacked the royal family with a variety of claims since the death of his son Dodi Fayed and Diana, princess of Wales in a Paris car crash in 1997. In May, Al-Fayed sold Harrods to the investment arm of Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund. No figure was given. In his letter, Al-Fayed called for the Qataris to keep two memorials to Diana and his son, which are located in the store. They are a statue of the two dancing together and a wine glass smudged with the princess’s lipstick from her last dinner before the crash. ""Unless and until this country gives the princess the thanks and devotion she deserves in the form of a fitting public memorial, this statue, ‘Innocent Victims’, should remain to remind the world of what was lost when two young people were on the brink of happiness together, were killed,"" he said. ""It is the only memorial to the princess in the country, if one discounts the misconceived municipal waterworks in Hyde Park that every year causes casualties among the children who slip over when paddling in it.""","The context explicitly mentions that Mohamed Al-Fayed was born in Bakos, Alexandria, Egypt. This directly answers the question of his birthplace in North Africa.",26,1,1,1,1,1,0,12401,1655,37.02211332321167,1110957020.5078125

Aung San Suu Kyi tells UN that the term 'Rohingya' will be avoided
Myanmar leader reiterates her stance that the word, used to describe a persecuted Muslim minority, is ‘controversial’ and her government won’t use it

Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has told the UN special rapporteur on human rights that the government will avoid using the term “Rohingya” to describe a persecuted Muslim minority in the country’s north-west.
The statement came as the top UN human rights official issued a report saying the Rohingya had been deprived of nationality and undergone systematic discrimination and severe restrictions on movements. They had also suffered executions and torture that together may amount to crimes against humanity, the report said.

Members of the group of about 1.1 million people, who identify themselves by the term Rohingya, are seen by many Myanmar Buddhists as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. The term is a divisive issue.
The UN human rights investigator, Yanghee Lee, met Aung San Suu Kyi in the capital Naypyitaw on her first trip to Myanmar since the Nobel Peace Prize winner took power in April.
“At their meeting here this morning, our foreign minister Daw Aung San Suu Kyi explained our stance on this issue that the controversial terms should be avoided,” said Aung Lin, the permanent secretary at the ministry of foreign affairs.
Aung San Suu Kyi is banned from presidency by the military-drafted constitution because her children have British citizenship. She holds offices of the state counsellor and the minister for foreign affairs, but is the de facto leader of the administration.
Feted in the west for her role as champion of Myanmar’s democratic opposition during long years of military rule and house arrest, Suu Kyi has been criticised overseas , and by some in Myanmar, for saying little about the abuses faced by the Rohingya.
Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, UN high commissioner for human rights said in the report the Rohingya were excluded from a number of professions and needed special paperwork to access hospitals, which has resulted in delays and deaths of babies and their mothers during childbirth.
It was the first time Zeid said these and other long-standing violations could add up to crimes against humanity, an international crime. Crimes against humanity are serious, widespread and systematic violations.
Some 120,000 Rohingya remain displaced in squalid camps since fighting erupted in Rakhine State between Buddhists and Muslims in 2012. Thousands have fled persecution and poverty.
“The new Government has inherited a situation where laws and policies are in place that are designed to deny fundamental rights to minorities, and where impunity for serious violations against such communities has encouraged further violence against them,” Zeid said.
Reversing such discrimination must be a priority for the new government “to halt ongoing violations and prevent further ones taking place against Myanmar’s ethnic and religious minorities,” Zeid said.
Aung San Suu Kyi has formed a committee to “bring peace and development” to the state in May, but its plans are not clear.

Storyline
At the beginning of the twentieth century, Jews and Orthodox Christians live in the little village of Anatevka in the pre-revolutionary Russia of the Czars. Among the traditions of the Jewish community, the matchmaker arranges the match and the father approves it. The milkman Reb Tevye is a poor man that has been married for twenty-five years with Golde and they have five daughters. When the local matchmaker Yente arranges the match between his older daughter Tzeitel and the old widow butcher Lazar Wolf, Tevye agrees with the wedding. However Tzeitel is in love with the poor tailor Motel Kamzoil and they ask permission to Tevye to get married that he accepts to please his daughter. Then his second daughter Hodel (Michele Marsh) and the revolutionary student Perchik decide to marry each other and Tevye is forced to accept. When Perchik is arrested by the Czar troops and sent to Siberia, Hodel decides to leave her family and homeland and travel to Siberia to be with her beloved Perchik....

Trivia
By the early 1970s Hollywood roadshow presentations--especially musicals--were now no longer popular with critics and audiences. Recent musicals, including Camelot (1967), Doctor Dolittle (1967), Star! (1968), Finian's Rainbow (1968), Sweet Charity (1969), Hello, Dolly! (1969), and On a Clear Day You Can See Forever (1970) were not as captivating, imaginative, realistic,, as the film adaptations of Broadway musicals prior, had been., those successful film adaptations, including West Side Story (1961), The Music Man (1962), Mary Poppins (1964), My Fair Lady (1964), The Sound of Music (1965), The Jungle Book (1967), Oliver! (1968), and Funny Girl (1968) were in the 1960s, so Norman Jewison , Walter Mirisch and United Artists were worried about how the film would do once it got released. When it was finally released in late 1971 it defied naysayers and received overwhelming critical acclaim and became the highest-grossing film of the year, besting films like Shaft (1971), Stanley Kubrick 's A Clockwork Orange (1971), Diamonds Are Forever (1971), Dirty Harry (1971) with Clint Eastwood , and the Academy Award-winning The French Connection (1971).

Subway, also called underground, tube, or métro,  underground railway system used to transport large numbers of passengers within urban and suburban areas. Subways are usually built under city streets for ease of construction, but they may take shortcuts and sometimes must pass under rivers. Outlying sections of the system usually emerge aboveground, becoming conventional railways or elevated transit lines. Subway trains are usually made up of a number of cars operated on the multiple-unit system.

The first subway system was proposed for London by Charles Pearson, a city solicitor, as part of a city-improvement plan shortly after the opening of the Thames Tunnel in 1843. After 10 years of discussion, Parliament authorized the construction of 3.75 miles (6 km) of underground railway between Farringdon Street and Bishop’s Road, Paddington. Work on the Metropolitan Railway began in 1860 by cut-and-cover methods —that is, by making trenches along the streets, giving them brick sides, providing girders or a brick arch for the roof, and then restoring the roadway on top. On Jan. 10, 1863, the line was opened using steam locomotives that burned coke and, later, coal; despite sulfurous fumes, the line was a success from its opening, carrying 9,500,000 passengers in the first year of its existence. In 1866 the City of London and Southwark Subway Company (later the City and South London Railway) began work on their “tube” line, using a tunneling shield developed by J.H. Greathead. The tunnels were driven at a depth sufficient to avoid interference with building foundations or public-utility works, and there was no disruption of street traffic. The original plan called for cable operation, but electric traction was substituted before the line was opened. Operation began on this first electric underground railway in 1890 with a uniform fare of twopence for any journey on the 3-mile (5-kilometre) line. In 1900 Charles Tyson Yerkes , an American railway magnate, arrived in London, and he was subsequently responsible for the construction of more tube railways and for the electrification of the cut-and-cover lines. During World Wars I and II the tube stations performed the unplanned function of air-raid shelters.

Many other cities followed London’s lead. In Budapest , a 2.5-mile (4-kilometre) electric subway was opened in 1896, using single cars with trolley poles; it was the first subway on the European continent. Considerable savings were achieved in its construction over earlier cut-and-cover methods by using a flat roof with steel beams instead of a brick arch, and therefore, a shallower trench.
In Paris , the Métro (Chemin de Fer Métropolitain de Paris) was started in 1898, and the first 6.25 miles (10 km) were opened in 1900. The rapid progress was attributed to the wide streets overhead and the modification of the cut-and-cover method devised by the French engineer Fulgence Bienvenue. Vertical shafts were sunk at intervals along the route; and, from there, side trenches were dug and masonry foundations to support wooden shuttering were placed immediately under the road surfaces. Construction of the roof arch then proceeded with relatively little disturbance to street traffic. This method, while it is still used in Paris, has not been widely copied in subway construction elsewhere.
In the United States the first practical subway line was constructed in Boston between 1895 and 1897. It was 1.5 miles (2.4 km) long and at first used trolley streetcars, or tramcars. Later, Boston acquired conventional subway trains. New York City opened the first section of what was to become the largest system in the world on Oct. 27, 1904. In Philadelphia, a subway system was opened in 1907, and Chicago’s system opened in 1943. Moscow constructed its original system in the 1930s.

tc_2116,Throughout the 80s and 90s Phil Collins recorded on which record label?,Atlantic,"This Week In History: FIRST Hits of the ‘70s, ‘80s & ‘90s « WCBS-FM 101.1
“Please Don’t Go”
KC and the Sunshine Band
The first No. 1 record of the 1980s was a comeback effort from the Hialeah, Florida-based ensemble, K.C. and the Sunshine Band with a BALLAD called “Please Don’t Go.” Wait—what? Yeah, it was a ballad from those disco/funk mavens of the ‘70s. But somehow, this record resonated with music lovers. Harry Wayne Casey (K.C.) formed what would become known as the Sunshine Band in 1973; initially with just his songwriting partner Richard Finch. I played their early recordings in the clubs at the Jersey Shore in late ’73 at the very, very start of what would become known as Disco music. Several musicians were added as the years went on for recording and live appearances. While on vacation in the spring of ’75, I remember sitting on the sands of Miami Beach and hearing a song called “Get Down Tonight” on the R&B stations of Miami. I turned to my then fiancé and said, “That will be a No. 1 Pop song by the summer. As you know, your Big Jay is rarely wrong, and indeed it was on top of the Hot 100 for a sole week in the summer of ’75. That was followed by “That’s The Way (I Like It)” at No. 1. A follow-up to that was a stinker on the Pop lists called “Queen Of Clubs.” But K.C. and Finch came up with another No. 1 smash “(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty” in ’76 on TK Records. Another stinker called “I Like To Do It” failed. Not to be deterred, “I’m Your Boogie Man” yielded yet another Pop chart-topper in ‘77, followed by “Keep It Comin’ Love” just missing the apex that year; stalling at No. 2. For some reason, after that hit, K.C. and the Sunshine Band couldn’t even reach the Top 30. However, “Boogie Shoes” a cut from the groups’ second album called K.C. and the Sunshine Band was resurrected from just being an album track to becoming a single and a key component to the film and soundtrack for Saturday Night Fever in 1978. And yet, after that was a charting 45 RPM, they still couldn’t duplicate its success. During the spring of ’79, K.C. and Finch wrote “Please Don’t Go” and included that on an album called Do You Wanna Go Party on TK Records. When released as a single in August of 1979, it seemed as if it wouldn’t catch on, being the first true ballad from the Disco mavens. But persistence paid off for not only TK Records and K.C. and the boys, becoming the very first No. 1 Pop hit of the 1980’s.
Not long after this record was recorded, K.C. (Harry Casey) decided to embark on a solo career. At first, while he was producing an album for an old high school friend Teri DeSario, her label’s head Neil Bogart (Casablanca Record) heard that K.C. was working on having her sing a remake of the 1965 smash for Barbara Lewis called “Yes I’m Ready.” Bogart wisely suggested it be done as a duet, with DeSario and Harry Casey. The only reason her version (with K.C.) didn’t reach No. 1 on the Hot 100, was because “Crazy Little Thing Called Love” stopped it at No. 2 for two weeks. After a serious motor-vehicle accident, where Harry was seriously injured, K.C. recovered after months of rehab, and, as a solo artist did manage to have one more “comeback” record in him called “Give It Up,” in the dance style that he was most known for; this time on the small Meca Records label after his label at the time Epic Records refused to release it. K.C. still tours with new musicians and has done a few concerts in conjunction with CBS-FM! He’s a great showman for sure. A postscript to the K.C. and the Sunshine Band story is that K.C.’s one-time writing and producing partner Richard Finch was arrested and convicted of sexual contact with male teens in (ahem) Licking County, Ohio. Finch is still incarcerated at an Ohio state penitentiary as of this writing.
First No. 1 Hit of the ‘90s

“Another Day In Paradise”
Phil Collins
Not bad for a guy who (as a young teen) was an extra in The Beatles ’ 1964 film A Hard Day’s Night and the guy who replaced Peter Gabriel in Genesis in 1975. The very first hit of the ‘90s decade was the very last No. 1 Hot 100 hit for Phil Collins with “Another Day In Paradise” on Atlantic Records. It was also the last No. 1 record of the ‘80s, as it had been a chart-topper for the last two weeks of that decade. But it was a strong No. 1 single, lasting four survey-phases in total as the prime hit in America. The tune was the first single from the Collins LP …But Seriously, released in September of ’89. That album was also was the first No. 1 LP in the ‘90s. The song “Another Day In Paradise” was yet another foray into the plight of homelessness that Collins had already tackled on a song he recorded with Genesis (with Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford) called “Man On The Corner” which only reached No. 40 on the Hot 100 back in 1981 from an otherwise fairly successful LP called Abacab. That album also featured the hits “No Reply At All” (No. 29 Pop in ‘81) and “Abacab” (No. 26 Pop, peaking in ‘82) on Atlantic Records. Back to “Another Day In Paradise”—the song featured singing legend David Crosby on backing vocals along with Dominic Miller on guitar, and Leland Sklar on bass.
“Another Day In Paradise” was Phil Collins’ seventh and final No. 1 single to date. The LP version of the song from …But Seriously, clocked in at over five minutes long; but was edited down to a more radio-friendly 4:04 for single release. “Another Day In Paradise” was eventually named Grammy® Record of the Year for 1990. It had also been nominated for Song of the Year, ultimately won by “From A Distance for songwriter Julie Gold, performed by Bette Midler, Best Music Video, Short Form, in the end won by the Paula Abdul song’s “Opposites Attract” video) and Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male, made victorious by the then recently deceased Roy Orbison for a remake of “Oh, Pretty Woman.” But it was the producer’s award that got Collins and co-producer Hugh Padgham their big winner at that ceremony in early ’91. Phil Collins and David Crosby performed the composition live on the night of the Grammy Awards® Show televised on NBC from Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan. Over in merry-old England, “Another Day In Paradise” won the BRIT Award® for Best British Single. His six other No. 1 songs include: “Against All Odds (Take A Look At Me Now)” from ’84, “One More Night” from ’85, “Sussudio” from the same year, and “Separate Lives” also from ’85—a duet with Marilyn Martin, “Groovy Kind Of Love” a re-make of the Mindbenders ’66 hit (co-written by a young Carole Bayer Sager and Toni Wine—the female singer on “Sugar, Sugar” by the Archies, and “Two Hearts,” No. 1 in early 1989 co-written by the great Motown and beyond legend, Lamont Dozier, Earth, Wind & Fire’s lead singer Phillip Bailey’s collaboration with Collins on “Easy Lover” reached No. 2 on the Hot 100 for two weeks in early ’85 prevented from the No. 1 spot by Foreigner’s “I Want To Know What Love Is.” And, though it wasn’t a gigantic hit (No. 21 Pop) the last entry from Phil Collins in the 1990s (1999 to be exact) won him an Oscar® for Best Song for “You’ll Be In My Heart” from the motion-picture Tarzan. Phillip David Charles Collins was inducted into the class of 2010 of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis.
Collins announced the next year that he was retiring from the recording and live concert business due to health issues including arm troubles due to playing the drums for so many years and some personal issues. But during the spring of 2015, Collins announced he was coming out of retirement. He planned to re-release re-mastered versions of his eight solo LPs, and would write a new album and return to the concert stage. In addition, Phil plans to have an autobiography released sometime in 2016.

To Err is Human; To Forgive Divine
Showing 1-3 of 3 messages
In the latest installment of the sermon series entitled ""No, that's NOT in
the Bible"" David Dykes addresses forgiveness as taught in the Bible.
May God bless,
To Err is Human; To Forgive Divine
by David O. Dykes
12 Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe
yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. 13
Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against
one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
In the series entitled ""No, that's NOT in the Bible"" we discover some of
these pseudo-scriptures actually contradict the Bible. For instance,
believing the adage ""God helps those who help themselves"" can hinder a
person from seeking God's help. The aphorism ""God won't put more on you than
you can bear"" can be dangerous because it can create confusion and guilt.
Have you ever heard someone say, ""The Bible says, 'to err is human; to
forgive, divine?'"" No, that's NOT in the Bible, but the statement is
basically true. We are all sinners. It's just part of our human nature. It
is part of God's divine nature to forgive, so when we forgive others, we are
displaying a God-like quality. But because we are human we all err.
Actually, the correct pronunciation of the word ""err"" rhymes with ""sir."" So,
we should say, ""to urr is human; to forgive divine."" But if I happen to
mispronounce it in this message, will you please act divinely and forgive
me?""
We all experience relationship problems in which we are hurt or offended, so
we'd better learn how to forgive. Even people in the church don't always get
along. Mike and I have a great relationship based on mutual love and
respect, but not every preacher and music director get along as well as we
do. I once heard the funny story of the minister of music who led songs
disagreeing with what the pastor was saying. For instance, one Sunday the
pastor preached on the importance of Christians moving out to share the
gospel with others. Immediately after the message the music director led the
hymn, ""We Shall not be Moved."" The next week the pastor preached on the
importance of everyone giving more money, and the music director followed it
with the hymn ""Jesus Paid it All."" The next week the pastor preached on the
dangers of gossip and the song that followed was ""I Love to Tell the Story.""
The pastor got so frustrated that Sunday night, he threatened to resign if
the music didn't change. The music director followed that with ""O, Why not
Tonight?"" Finally the pastor was so fed up that the next Sunday he said, ""I've
had it with this church. Jesus is leading me to leave and go to another
church."" And the minister of music stood and said, ""Let's all sing 'What a
Friend We have in Jesus!'""
The first part of this adage was a common Latin proverb ""errare humanum
 est."" In 1711, the English Poet Alexander Pope wrote an ""Essay on
 Criticism"" in which he made the statement ""Good nature and good sense must
ever join / To err is human; to forgive, divine.""
Since that time there have been several interesting variations on Pope's
statement. Dog lovers claim: ""To err is human; to forgive canine."" Mae West
was once quoted as saying, ""To err is human, but it feels divine."" For
anyone who works with computers today you'll agree: ""To err is human-but to
really mess things up you need a computer."" Someone wisely observed, ""To err
is human, and to cover it up is too!""
One of the most powerful passages about forgiveness is found in Colossians
3:12-13, ""Therefore as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe
yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience.
Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against
one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put
on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.""
Because of our errors, we desperately need divine forgiveness. The Bible
teaches God loves us and offers us forgiveness as a free gift; it's part of
God's nature to display this amazing grace.
In the Model Prayer Jesus taught us to pray, ""Forgive us our trespasses as
we forgive those who trespass against us."" Accepting God's forgiveness is a
lot easier than forgiving others who have hurt and offended us. In this
message I want to help you understand six important principles about
forgiveness.
1. FORGIVENESS IS NOT A FEELING-IT'S A DECISION
As we examine these six principles of forgiveness, can you think of anyone
at this moment who hurt you so deeply you are struggling with being able to
forgive them? It may be an ex-spouse, or a former boss, or a family member
with whom you are currently estranged. Will you ask the Holy Spirit to put a

Was Dr Crippen innocent of his wife's murder? - BBC News BBC News Was Dr Crippen innocent of his wife's murder? 29 July 2010 Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Hawley Crippen, the doctor hanged for the gruesome murder of his wife Cora, is one of the most infamous killers in British history. Exactly 100 years after his arrest, why is there a campaign to prove his innocence, asks Stephen Tomkins? Having the surname Crippen does not endear you to UK Customs, according to a distant relative of the infamous doctor convicted of killing his wife. James Patrick Crippen of Ohio, second cousin three times removed of Dr Hawley Crippen, hopes to officially exonerate the black sheep of the family and bring his remains to the family plot in Michigan for a decent burial. ""The evidence says the man should be pardoned,"" he says. ""But everyone thinks of him as a murderer. Every time I have come through customs to England, someone has made a comment on my name, linking me to a murderer."" Crippen rose to infamy by allegedly poisoning and dismembering his wife, hiding her remains under the basement floor, and fleeing for North America with his lover - and then being the first person to be caught using the wireless telegraph. The message was sent 100 years ago, and Crippen was arrested on arrival in Quebec on 31 July, 1910. His trial lasted only five days, and the jury's deliberations for less than half an hour. The role of wireless radio Captain Henry Kendall saw through Crippen's disguise as the doctor boarded his ship with his lover dressed as a boy The SS Montrose was one of very few Canadian Pacific liners fitted with a Marconi wireless radio Kendall had the operator wire the White Star Line Offices in London The message read: ""Have strong suspicions that Crippen - London cellar murderer and accomplice are among Saloon passengers. Moustache taken off - growing beard. Accomplice dressed as boy. Voice manner and build undoubtedly a girl."" British police caught a faster ship to Quebec and were there for Crippen's arrival The torso was identified as Cora Crippen's by a scar, the doctor was shown to have bought a large amount of the drug that killed her, and on his arrest he told Chief Inspector Dew: ""I am not sorry; the anxiety has been too much."" The mild-mannered murderer became a national celebrity and his waxwork stands in Madame Tussauds to this day. But was it all a huge miscarriage of justice? Was Crippen innocent after all? A growing body of people believe so, including family members and forensic scientists, and a campaign is under way to clear his name. One line of evidence comes from John Trestrail, a toxicologist who has long puzzled over the mutilation of the corpse. The remains found were a torso without bones or sex organs. Mutilation is extremely unusual behaviour among poisoners, Mr Trestrail says. ""A poisoner wants the death to appear natural so he can get a death certificate. This is the only case I know of where the victim was dismembered. It doesn't make sense."" 'He finally cracked' Mr Trestrail brought in Professor David Foran, director of forensic science at Michigan State University, who led DNA analysis on the scarred skin of the corpse used in the trial. It was demanding work over two years, retrieving tissue preserved in formaldehyde from the glass slide it was attached to with pine resin. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Crippen's house in north London has since been demolished Mr Foran followed two lines of research and considers the results conclusive. First he isolated mitochondrial DNA, which remains unchanged throughout the generations down the female line. A genealogist found grandnieces of Cora Crippen who would have the same mitochondrial DNA as her, and repeated tests found they were not related to the body in the basement. Then Mr Foran's team used new techniques to examine the nuclear DNA, and discovered a Y chromosome. Not only was the body not from Cora Crippen's family, it wasn't even a woman. As Mr Trestrail sums it up, ""This is the slide which Spilsbury [the expert witness at the trial] used to identify the body as Cora Crippen's. And this was the evidence on which Crippen was convicted. But the substance in the slide is not Cora Crippen. No question. I don't say Hawley Crippen is innocent, but he is no longer proven guilty."" Not everyone is convinced, however. John Boyne, whose book Crippen: A Novel of Murder, is to be reissued next year, says: ""I think Crippen probably did kill his wife. His actions suggest guilt - his decision to flee the country and to dress Ethel LeNeve as his son rather than allow her to reveal her true identity on the ship as his lover. Cora made his life so miserable that I think he finally cracked."" I have no interest in clearing Crippen's name. What I care about is being right Professor David Foran, Forensic scientist Jonathan Menges, a writer and genealogist from San Diego, has written disputing Mr Foran's findings. Mr Menges claims the genealogy linking the living relatives to Cora Crippen is flawed - no birth certificate for her exists, for example, as they were rare in the US at the time - making the mitochondrial DNA tests irrelevant. He criticises the proceedings for having too much of an eye for showbiz - the nuclear DNA findings were first revealed on a TV documentary - and points out that they have not yet been published or peer-reviewed. He says that Crippen's behaviour demonstrates his guilt, and that a group in Salt Lake City are investigating the mysterious disappearance there of Crippen's first wife. ""There is no doubt that Crippen is guilty,"" he says. Mr Foran responds that his work is to be published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, that he is fully satisfied by the genealogy, and that the remains are indisputably male. ""I don't really care one way or the other whether the body was Cora Crippen's, I have no interest in clearing Crippen's name. What I care about is being right. We tested and tested and tested, and if I had any doubts whatsoever I would never have come out with it. The body is not Cora Crippen's."" Nevertheless, JP Crippen has failed to get the case reopened. The Criminal Cases Review Commission declined to refer it to the Court of Appeal, because he is too distant a relative to have sufficient interest. But Mr Trestrail agrees with him that the campaign to clear his name should continue. ""It matters,"" he says. ""Justice doesn't have a time limit.""","The context explicitly states that Dr. Crippen was convicted of murdering his wife, Cora Henrietta Crippen, and that the remains found in his cellar were identified as hers. Despite later DNA evidence suggesting the remains may not be hers, the context confirms his conviction for her murder.",51,1,1,1,1,1,0,17830,1828,44.50759220123291,1110957020.5078125

Our government at work — This is the daily “Profile America” feature from the U.S. Census Bureau for today, Friday, October 8th. This is the 81st anniversary of the first in-flight movie ever shown. A little-known travel gem.
Friday, October 8th, celebrates one of the few joys left in long-distance flying, sitting back and enjoying a feature-length movie. But recently, one major airline announced it will be ending this entertainment, joining several low-cost airlines in the policy. While movies have been generally available on long flights for decades, the first movies shown in the air were a newsreel and two cartoons. These were shown on this date in 1929 aboard a Ford Trimotor operated by Transcontinental Air Transport. Regular in-flight movie service began in July 1961 on a Trans World airline flight from New York to Los Angeles. Now, more than 3.9 million passengers fly between New York and Los Angeles every year. You can find these and more facts about America from the U.S. Census Bureau online at

tc_2317,Who was the first American to travel faster than the speed of sound?,Chuck Yeager,"Yeager breaks sound barrier - Oct 14, 1947 - HISTORY.com Yeager breaks sound barrier Publisher A+E Networks U.S. Air Force Captain Chuck Yeager becomes the first person to fly faster than the speed of sound. Yeager, born in Myra, West Virginia, in 1923, was a combat fighter during World War II and flew 64 missions over Europe. He shot down 13 German planes and was himself shot down over France, but he escaped capture with the assistance of the French Underground. After the war, he was among several volunteers chosen to test-fly the experimental X-1 rocket plane, built by the Bell Aircraft Company to explore the possibility of supersonic flight. For years, many aviators believed that man was not meant to fly faster than the speed of sound, theorizing that transonic drag rise would tear any aircraft apart. All that changed on October 14, 1947, when Yeager flew the X-1 over Rogers Dry Lake in Southern California. The X-1 was lifted to an altitude of 25,000 feet by a B-29 aircraft and then released through the bomb bay, rocketing to 40,000 feet and exceeding 662 miles per hour (the sound barrier at that altitude). The rocket plane, nicknamed “Glamorous Glennis,” was designed with thin, unswept wings and a streamlined fuselage modeled after a .50-caliber bullet. Because of the secrecy of the project, Bell and Yeager’s achievement was not announced until June 1948. Yeager continued to serve as a test pilot, and in 1953 he flew 1,650 miles per hour in an X-1A rocket plane. He retired from the U.S. Air Force in 1975 with the rank of brigadier general.","The context explicitly states that Chuck Yeager became the first person to fly faster than the speed of sound on October 14, 1947, in the Bell X-1 aircraft.

11 Oldest Continuously Inhabited Cities in the World

Ever since man learned to grow their own food and rear cattle, they have been living in permanent to semi-permanent settlements with certain degree of planning. Although opinions vary on whether any particular ancient settlement can be considered to be a city, there is no doubt that towns and cities have a long history.
The earliest civilizations in history were established in the region known as Mesopotamia, largely corresponding to modern-day Iraq, northeastern Syria, southeastern Turkey and southwestern Iran. Archaeological remains unearthed in Mesopotamia provides proof of settlements dating back to 10,000 BC. After Mesopotamia, the city culture arose in Syria and Anatolia, as shown by the city of Çatalhöyük (7500-5700BC). Mohenjodaro of the Indus Valley Civilization in present-day Pakistan existed from about 2600 BC and was one of the largest ancient cites with a population of 50,000 or more.
While it might not be too difficult to determine which is the oldest city in the world, there is fierce contention for the title of the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world. Often the age claims are disputed and historical evidences are difficult to prove. Then there are differences in opinion as to the definitions of ""city"" as well as ""continuously inhabited"". In any case, the following cities besides being some of the ancient in the world, they continue to grow and thrive until the present day.
Jericho, Israel
Continuously Inhabited Since: 9000 BC
Jericho is a city located near the Jordan River in the West Bank of the Palestinian territories, capital of the Jericho Governorate and with a modest population of around 20,000. Situated well below sea level Jericho is believed to be the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world.
Described in the Old Testament as the ""City of Palm Trees"", copious springs in and around Jericho have made it an attractive site for human habitation for thousands of years. Archaeologists have unearthed the remains of more than 20 successive settlements in Jericho, the first of which dates back 11,000 years (9000 BCE), almost to the very beginning of the Holocene epoch of the Earth's history.
During the Younger Dryas period of cold and drought, permanent habitation of any one location was not possible. However, the spring at what would become Jericho was a popular camping ground for hunter-gatherer groups, who left a scattering stone tools behind them. Around 9600 BCE the droughts and cold of the Younger Dryas Stadial had come to an end, making it possible for groups to extend the duration of their stay, eventually leading to year round habitation and permanent settlement. By about 9400 BCE Jericho had more than 70 dwellings, and was home to over 1000 people.
Damascus, Syria
Continuously Inhabited Since: 6300 BC
Damascus is the capital and the second largest city of Syria. In addition to being one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, Damascus is a major cultural and religious center of the Levant.
Damascus is often claimed to be the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world, and evidence exists of a settlement in the wider Barada basin dating back to 9000 BC. However within the area of Damascus there is no evidence for large-scale settlement until the second millennium BC. Carbon-14 dating at Tell Ramad, on the outskirts of Damascus, suggests that the site may have been occupied since the second half of the seventh millennium BC, possibly around 6300 BC.
Byblos, Lebanon
Continuously Inhabited Since: 5000 BC
Byblos is a Mediterranean city in the Mount Lebanon Governorate of present-day Lebanon. It is believed to have been founded around 5000 BC, and according to fragments attributed to the semi-legendary pre-Trojan war Phoenician historian Sanchuniathon, it was built by Cronus as the first city in Phoenicia.

Different types of Coal – Coal Types WA | Griffin Coal
Coal Types
Vast specifications from locations all over the world.
There are several different types of coal, that have different properties usually dependent on their age and the depth to which they have been buried under other rocks.
In some parts of the world (for example New Zealand), coal development is accelerated by volcanic heat or crustal stresses. The degree of coal development is referred to as a coal’s “rank,” with peat being the lowest rank coal and anthracite the highest.
Peat
Peat is the layer of vegetable material directly underlying the growing zone of a coal forming environment. The vegetable material shows very little alteration and contains the roots of living plants. Peat is widely used as a domestic fuel in rural parts of Scotland and Ireland.
Lignite
Lignite is geologically very young (upwards of around 40,000 years). It is brown and can be soft and fibrous, containing discernible plant material. It also contains large amounts of moisture (around 70%) and so has a low energy content: around 8 to 10 megajoules per kilogram. This coal is mined extensively in the Latrobe Valley south east of Melbourne, Australia. As the coal develops it loses its fibrous character and darkens in colour.
Black coal
In Australia, black coal ranges from Cretaceous age (65 to 105 million years ago) to mid Permian age (up to 260 million years ago). They are all black; some are sooty and still quite high in moisture (sub-bituminous coal), including the coal mined at Collie, which is sometimes termed a ""black lignite.""
Coals that get more deeply buried by other rocks lose more moisture and start to lose their oxygen and hydrogen. These coals are harder and shinier (bituminous coal). These are typical of most of the coals mined in NSW and Queensland, which have energy contents around 24 to 28 megajoules per kilogram. These coals generally have less than 3% moisture, but some power stations in NSW and Queensland burn coal at up to 30% ash.
Anthracite
Anthracite is a hard, black, shiny form of coal that contains virtually no moisture and very low volatile content. Because of this, it burns with little or no smoke and is sold as a “smokeless fuel”.
In Australia, coals only approach anthracite composition where bituminous coal seams have been compressed further by local crustal movements (at Yarrabee and Baralaba, both in Queensland). Anthracites can have energy contents up to about 32 megajoules per kilogram, depending on the ash content.
Coal rank has little to do with quality; as a coal matures its ash content actually increases as a proportion because of the loss of moisture and volatiles. Lower rank coals may have lower energy contents, but they tend to be more reactive (they burn faster) because of their porosity and resultant higher surface area.

Discover the chemistry of truffles, the most expensive food in the world. © American Chemical Society (A Britannica Publishing Partner) Black truffles. Poppy A section of a young specimen shows a whitish homogeneous flesh that with age becomes a rich dark colour showing a lighter marbling. Truffles flourish in open woodland on calcareous soil. They are saprophytes, usually associated with the roots of trees, possibly in a mutually beneficial association (see mycorrhiza ). The spores of Tuber are large; one to four may be seen in a spore sac, or ascus. (These, the first ascospores to be observed, were described by French botanist Joseph Pitton de Tournefort in 1701–11.) The most-valued truffle in French cuisine is the Périgord (Tuber melanosporum), which is said to have first gained favour toward the end of the 15th century. It is brown or black, rounded, and covered with polygonal wartlike protrusions, having a depression at their summit; the flesh (gleba) is first white, then brown or gray, and when mature becomes black with white veins having a brown margin. The odour is well marked and pleasant. The main French truffières (truffle grounds) are in the south, notably in Périgord and the région of Provence–Alpes–Côte d’Azur , though truffles are gathered throughout a large part of France. The truffle industry is an important one in France, and about one-third of the gatherings are exported. The French government undertook the reforesting of many large and barren areas, for many of the best truffle regions become productive by the planting of trees, particularly oaks. Because truffles often occur at depths down to about 30 centimetres (12 inches), it is difficult to detect them unaided. Truffles, when occurring near the surface of the ground, crack it as they reach full size, and experienced gatherers can detect them. Furthermore, in the morning and evening, columns of small yellow flies may be seen hovering over a colony. Occasionally an individual is sufficiently sensitive to the scent of truffles to locate them, but truffle hunting is usually carried on with the aid of trained dogs or female pigs (which are attracted by the truffle’s scent, similar to that of male pig pheromones). Britannica Stories Ringling Bros. Folds Its Tent Although truffles are much desired as food, direct cultivation of truffles for commerce is difficult. Calcareous ground is dug over and acorns or seedlings planted. Soil from truffle areas is usually spread about, and the ground is kept in condition by light plowing and harrowing. After three years, clearings are made and the trees pruned. If they are to appear, truffles do so only after about five years; gathering begins then but is not very profitable until 8 or 10 years have passed. The yield is at its maximum from 5 to 25 years later. The English truffle, T. aestivum, is found principally in beech woods. It is bluish black, rounded, and covered with coarse polygonal warts; the gleba is white when immature, then yellowish, and finally brown with white branched markings. Truffles are relatively rare in North America , being found most often in temperate forests of the Pacific Northwest . In addition to the “true truffles,” there are a number of “false truffles,” which are classified as club fungi ( Basidiomycota ). The Basidiomycota include puffballs, mushrooms, shelf fungi, and plant rusts and smuts. Similar to the Ascomycota in many ways, they differ in bearing their spores on the outside rather than inside.","The context explicitly identifies truffles as a type of fungus, belonging to the kingdom Fungi.

Plant cell walls also contain many proteins and glycoproteins, including various enzymes and structural proteins ( Rose and Lee, 2010 ). For example, arabinogalactan proteins are structurally complex molecules found on the plasma membrane and in the cell wall; they are thought to play important roles in recognition and signaling events at the cell surface ( Ellis et al., 2010 ).

What is a green pigment that traps energy from sunlight?
A:
Quick Answer
The green pigment that traps energy from sunlight is called chlorophyll. This pigment is found in special cell organelles called chloroplasts and it is also found in some special anaerobic bacteria called cyanobacteria. Chloroplasts are found only in the cells of the leaves of green plants.
Full Answer
During the daytime, when sunlight falls on green leaves, it traps the solar energy and converts it into simple carbohydrates such as glucose and starch. Thus, it helps to convert solar energy into chemical form.
This process is called photosynthesis and takes place only in green plants. For photosynthesis to take place, carbon dioxide and water vapor are also necessary. Oxygen is given out during the process of photosynthesis.
Photosynthetic Pigments
Photosynthetic Pigments
Pigments are colorful compounds.
Pigments are chemical compounds which reflect only certain  wavelengths of visible light.  This makes them appear ""colorful"".  Flowers,  corals, and even animal skin contain pigments which give them their colors.  More important than their reflection of light is the ability of pigments  to absorb certain wavelengths.
Because they interact with light to absorb only certain wavelengths,  pigments are useful to plants and other autotrophs --organisms  which make their own food using photosynthesis.   In plants , algae,  and cyanobacteria ,  pigments are the means  by which the energy of sunlight is captured for photosynthesis. However, since each pigment reacts with only a narrow range of the spectrum, there is usually a need to produce several kinds of pigments,  each of a different color, to capture more of the sun's energy.
There are three basic classes of pigments.
Chlorophylls are greenish pigments which contain a porphyrin ring.  This is a stable ring-shaped molecule around which  electrons are free to migrate.  Because the electrons move freely, the ring has  the potential to gain or lose electrons easily, and thus the potential to provide  energized electrons to other molecules.  This is the fundamental process by  which chlorophyll ""captures"" the energy of sunlight.
There are several kinds of chlorophyll, the most important being  chlorophyll ""a"".  This is the molecule which makes photosynthesis possible,  by passing its energized electrons on to molecules which will manufacture  sugars.  All plants, algae, and cyanobacteria which photosynthesize contain  chlorophyll ""a"".  A second kind of chlorophyll is chlorophyll ""b"", which occurs only in ""green algae"" and in the plants .   A third form of chlorophyll which is common is (not  surprisingly) called chlorophyll ""c"", and is found only in the photosynthetic  members of the Chromista as well as the dinoflagellates .   The differences between the chlorophylls of these major groups was one of  the first clues that they were not as closely related as previously thought.","The context explicitly states that the green pigment used by plants to trap sunlight is chlorophyll. Multiple passages in the context confirm this, including references to chlorophyll's role in photosynthesis, its presence in chloroplasts, and its function in absorbing light energy.

Carolus Linnaeus (1758) was the pioneer in developing a classification system for birds and animals. He proposed the classification of animals into groups that had things in common.

Plant Kingdom
Plant Kingdom
(or Plantae )
Virtually all other living creatures depend on plants to survive.     Through photosynthesis , plants     convert energy from sunlight into food stored as carbohydrates. Because     animals cannot get energy directly from the sun, they must eat plants (or     other animals that have had a vegetarian meal) to survive. Plants also     provide the oxygen humans and animals breathe, because plants use carbon     dioxide for photosynthesis and release oxygen into the atmosphere.
Plants are found on land, in oceans, and in fresh water. They have been     on Earth for millions of years. Plants were on Earth before animals and     currently number about 260,000 species. Three features distinguish plants     from animals:
Plants have chlorophyll , a green       pigment necessary for photosynthesis;
Their cell walls are made sturdy by a material called cellulose ; and
They are fixed in one place (they don’t move).
Plant Classification
In order to study the billions of different organisms living on earth,     biologists have sorted and classified them based on their similarities and     differences. This system of classification is also     called a taxonomy and usually     features both English and Latin names for the different divisions.
All plants are included in one so-called kingdom (Kingdom Plantae), which is then broken down into smaller and smaller     divisions based on several characteristics, including:
Whether they can circulate fluids (like rainwater) through their       bodies or need to absorb them from the moisture that surrounds       them;
How they reproduce (e.g., by spores or different kinds       of seeds); and
Their size or stature.
The majority of the 260,000 plant species are flowering herbs. To     describe all plant species, the following divisions (or phyla) are most     commonly used to sort them. The first grouping is made up of plants that     are non-vascular; they cannot circulate rainwater through their stems and     leaves but must absorb it from the environment that surrounds them. The     remaining plant species are all vascular (they have a     system for circulating fluids). This larger group is then split into two     groups: one that reproduces from spores rather than seeds, and the other     that reproduces from seeds.
Non-Vascular Plants
Mosses and “allies,” or related species (Bryophyta and     allies)
Mosses or bryophyta are non-vascular. They are an important     foundation plant for the forest ecosystem and they help prevent erosion by     carpeting the forest floor. All bryophyte species reproduce by spores not     seeds, never have flowers, and are found growing on the ground, on rocks,     and on other plants.
Originally grouped as a single division or phylum, the 24,000     bryophyte species are now grouped in three divisions: Mosses (Bryophyta), Liverworts (Hepatophyta), and Hornworts (Anthocerotophyta). Also included among the non-vascular plants     is Chlorophyta , a kind of fresh-water algae.
Vascular Plants with Spores
Ferns and allies (Pteridophyta and allies)
Unlike mosses, ferns and related species have a vascular system, but     like mosses, they reproduce from spores rather than seeds. The ferns are     the most plentiful plant division in this group, with 12,000 species.     Other divisions (the fern allies) include Club mosses or Lycopods     (Lycopodiophyta) with 1,000 species, Horsetails (Equisetophyta)     with 40 species, and Whisk ferns (Psilophyta) with 3 species.

Insulin Regulation of Blood Sugar and Diabetes - The Important Roles of Insulin and Glucagon: Diabetes and Hypoglycemia
Normal Regulation of Blood Glucose
The Important Roles of Insulin and Glucagon: Diabetes and Hypoglycemia
Written by James  Norman MD, FACS, FACE
The human body wants blood glucose (blood sugar) maintained in a very narrow range. Insulin and glucagon are the hormones which make this happen. Both insulin and glucagon are secreted from the pancreas, and thus are referred to as pancreatic endocrine hormones. The picture on the left shows the intimate relationship both insulin and glucagon have to each other. Note that the pancreas serves as the central player in this scheme.  It is the production of insulin and glucagon by the pancreas which ultimately determines if a patient has diabetes, hypoglycemia, or some other sugar problem.
In this Article
Insulin's Role in Blood Glucose Control
Insulin Basics: How Insulin Helps Control Blood Glucose Levels
Insulin and glucagon are hormones secreted by islet cells within the pancreas. They are both secreted in response to blood sugar levels, but in opposite fashion!
Insulin is normally secreted by the beta cells (a type of islet cell) of the pancreas. The stimulus for insulin secretion is a HIGH blood glucose...it's as simple as that!  Although there is always a low level of insulin secreted by the pancreas, the amount secreted into the blood increases as the blood glucose rises. Similarly, as blood glucose falls, the amount of insulin secreted by the pancreatic islets goes down. 
As can be seen in the picture, insulin has an effect on a number of cells, including muscle, red blood cells, and fat cells.  In response to insulin, these cells absorb glucose out of the blood, having the net effect of lowering the high blood glucose levels into the normal range.
Glucagon is secreted by the alpha cells of the pancreatic islets in much the same manner as insulin...except in the opposite direction. If blood glucose is high, then no glucagon is secreted. 
When blood glucose goes LOW, however, (such as between meals, and during exercise) more and more glucagon is secreted. Like insulin, glucagon has an effect on many cells of the body, but most notably the liver.
The Role of Glucagon in Blood Glucose Control
The effect of glucagon is to make the liver release the glucose it has stored in its cells into the bloodstream, with the net effect of increasing blood glucose. Glucagon also induces the liver (and some other cells such as muscle) to make glucose out of building blocks obtained from other nutrients found in the body (eg, protein).
Our bodies desire blood glucose to be maintained between 70 mg/dl and 110 mg/dl (mg/dl means milligrams of glucose in 100 milliliters of blood). Below 70 is termed ""hypoglycemia."" Above 110 can be normal if you have eaten within 2 to 3 hours.  That is why your doctor wants to measure your blood glucose while you are fasting...it should be between 70 and 110.  Even after you have eaten, however, your glucose should be below 180. Above 180 is termed ""hyperglycemia"" (which translates to mean ""too much glucose in the blood""). If your 2 two blood sugar measurements above 200 after drinking a sugar-water drink (glucose tolerance test), then you are diagnosed with diabetes.

The ovaries are magnificent glands which are part of the female reproductive system. The ovaries are about the size and shape of an almond and sit just above the fallopian tubes -- one ovary on each side of the uterus. Every month during ovulation, either the right or left ovary produces a single mature egg for fertilization.
Did you know that when a baby girl is born, she already has about 1,000,000 ovarian follicles?
Each ovarian follicle contains a hollow ball of cells with an immature egg in the center. During childhood, approximately half of ovarian follicles are absorbed by the body. By the time a girl reaches puberty and her menstrual cycle begins, only about 400,000 ovarian follicles are left to develop into mature eggs.
Although only one egg usually fully matures during ovulation, somewhere between ten and 20 follicles begin the process of maturation monthly. The excess ovarian follicles are reabsorbed before ovulation occurs.
The process of ovulation is started and controlled by a drop in the hormone estrogen (mostly estradiol secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) thus sending a message to the pituitary gland to increase its secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). The increase in FSH causes the growth of ten to 20 of the ovarian follicles.
Estrogen is secreted by some of the cells in the follicle.
Just before ovulation occurs, the follicle that contains the maturing egg eases toward the surface of the ovary. Once the matured egg reaches the ovarian surface, ovulation occurs when the follicle and the ovarian surface open allowing the egg to drift out of the ovary.
Additionally, progesterone is also produced by the cells in the ovarian follicles shortly before ovulation occurs.
After ovulation, if pregnancy has not occurred, the empty follicle is called the corpus luteum and it is reabsorbed into the body. If pregnancy does occur the corpus luteum produces hormones that help to maintain the pregnancy.
After the egg is released from the ovary it travels to the oviducts (the funnel-shaped ends of the fallopian tubes) where it begins its long journey of several days into the uterus. The mature egg is moved along on its journey through the fallopian tubes by wavelike muscle contractions in the fallopian tube. The inner lining of each fallopian tube contains cilia which are constantly beating microscopic hairs; these cilia are what helps move the sperm towards the egg if a woman has had unprotected sexual intercourse. Conception (the fertilization of an egg with sperm) most often occurs in the part of the tubes that is nearest the ovary. Five to six days are required for the fertilized egg to reach the uterus.
Midcycle Pain or Discomfort
Some women experience a twinge, a cramp, or some discomfort in the lower back or abdomen when ovulation occurs.
Women sometimes notice a small amount of vaginal discharge, sometimes containing a small amount of blood, during ovulation. For some women these symptoms are severe enough to be mistaken for an  ectopic pregnancy  or appendicitis. Other women experience headaches, gastric pain, or a general  malaise ; while others women experience feeling much better during ovulation. When women experience these symptoms during ovulation it is called Mittelschmerz or midcyle pain.
Ovarian Cysts
Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs, similar to blisters. Ovarian cysts are common among women during their reproductive years and are growths that form on either of the two almond-sized glands on each side of the uterus. Most types of ovarian cysts are harmless and go away without any treatment.

Hormones and Your Menstrual Cycle
By Dawn Stacey, PhD, LMHC - Reviewed by a board-certified physician.
Updated June 15, 2016
Question: How Do Hormones Control Your Menstrual Cycle?
Your menstrual cycle is controlled by hormone signals in the brain. Each month, your ovary will release an egg (known as ovulation ) after the egg has matured. The egg enters into the fallopian tube and makes its way down to the uterus with hopes that a sperm will fertilize it. Your monthly menstrual cycle begins on the first day of your period and lasts until the first day of your next period.
There are Two Parts of Your Menstrual Cycle:
The first part of your menstrual cycle is called the follicular phase. This phase starts on the first day of your last period and continues until the day you ovulate. This phase of your menstrual cycle may be different for every woman (lasting anywhere from 7 days until 40 days). The second part of your menstrual cycle is called the luteal phase. This phase begins on the day of ovulation and lasts until your next period starts. The luteal phase usually has a more precise timeline -- for most women, this part of your menstrual cycle typically lasts around 12-16 days. 
Breaking Down Your Menstrual Cycle:
Now that you understand the two phases of your menstrual cycle, let’s take a look at what is normally going on inside your body each month. This is where you can see how your hormones are controlling what is happening.
Hormones and the Follicular Phase:
The Starting Place:
Everything begins with when the hypothalamus (a structure in your brain) produces the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).
Once produced, the GnRH will then trigger your pituitary gland to release the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). This hormone's job is to stimulate the growth and development of your eggs.
The Follicle Stimulating Hormone:
The FSH then makes the journey through your bloodstream to your ovaries.
Once the follicle stimulating hormone arrives, it triggers the growth of a follicle (a small sac that contains an egg) to develop into a mature egg.
The Role of the Follicle:
As the follicle develops and matures, it produces the hormone, estrogen .
After about 10 days, the estrogen levels reach high numbers.
The estrogen level peaks approximately one day before ovulation (in a 28-day cycle, this is is typically day 13).
This estrogen peak tells the brain that the egg has matured and triggers the pituitary gland to release a surge of luteinizing hormone (LH).
The LH Surge:
This LH surge acts as a cue to the ovarian follicle.
About 24-36 hours after the LH surge , a mature egg breaks out of the ovary and is released into the fallopian tube -- this is ovulation.
The egg leaves behind the corpus luteum (the empty follicle).
Hormones and the Luteal Phase:
The Corpus Luteum:
The cells of the corpus luteum release the hormone progesterone. This hormone helps to thicken and prepare your uterine lining for the implantation of a fertilized egg.
The corpus luteum will continue to make progesterone during the luteal phase of your menstrual cycle -- which is around 12-16 days.
After ovulation, if your egg is fertilized, the corpus luteum will continue to make progesterone to help sustain your pregnancy until the placenta is ready to do this job. 
The Shrinking of the Corpus Luteum:
If, after ovulation, the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum will begin to shrink.
It stops making progesterone -- which leads to no more hormones being made to support the uterine lining.
The lining will begin to shed off.
This leads the start of your monthly period.
The low levels of estrogen and progesterone will then signal the hypothalamus to start the whole menstrual cycle process over again.

Most Abundant Gas in the Earth's Atmosphere
Updated March 14, 2016.
Question: What Is the Most Abundant Gas in the Earth's Atmosphere?
The Earth's atmosphere or air is composed of several gases. One gas is much more abundant than any other. Can you guess which one it is?
Answer: By far, the most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere is nitrogen , which accounts for about 78% of the mass of dry air. Oxygen is the next most abundant gas, present at levels of 20-21%. Although humid air seems like it contains a lot of water, the maximum amount of water vapor that air can hold is only about 4%.
Abundance of Gases in the Atmosphere
This table lists the eleven most abundant gases in the lower portion of Earth's atmosphere (up to 25 km). While the percentage of nitrogen and oxygen are fairly stable, the amount of greenhouse gases changes and depends on location. Water vapor is extremely variable. In arid or extremely cold regions, water vapor may be nearly absent. In warm, tropical regions, water vapor accounts for a significant portion of atmospheric gases.

The average concentration of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxde, methane, and nitrous dioxide has been increasing. Ozone is concentrated around cities and in the Earth's stratosphere. In addition to the elements in the table and krypton, xenon, nitrogen dioxide, and iodine (all mentioned earlier), there are trace amounts of ammonia, carbon monoxide, and several other gases.
Why Is Important To Know the Abundance of Gases?
It's important to know which gas is most abundant, what the other gases are in the Earth's atmosphere, and how the composition of air changes with altitude and over time for multiple reasons. The information helps us understand and predict the weather. The amount of water vapor in air is particularly relevant to weather forecasting. The gas composition helps us understand the effects of natural and manmade chemicals released into the atmosphere. The make-up of the atmosphere is extremely important for climate, so changes in gases may help us predict broad climate change.

The atmosphere is a mixture of gases that surround the Earth. It is essential to all life and serves several purposes, such as providing air for respiration, absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, protecting the earth from falling meteorites, controlling climate and regulating the water cycle. The Earth’s atmosphere is composed of approximately 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, 1 percent argon and trace amounts of other gases that include carbon dioxide and neon.

Evidence for nutrient enrichment of high-elevation lakes in the Sierra Nevada, California Evidence for nutrient enrichment of high-elevation lakes in the Sierra Nevada, California Limnology and Oceanography Download citation as: RIS Abstract Long-term measurements (1983-2001) of nutrients and seston in Emerald Lake (Sierra Nevada, California) have revealed ecologically significant patterns. Nitrate, both during spring runoff and during growing seasons, declined from 1983 through 1995. Declining snowmelt nitrate was caused primarily by changes in snow regime induced by the 1987-1992 drought: years with shallow, early melting snowpacks had lower snowmelt nitrate concentrations owing to less labile N production in catchment soils and longer plant growing seasons. However, nitrate declines during growing seasons carried through the wetter years of 1993-2000 and are likely the result of increased P loading to the lake and the release of phytoplankton from P limitation. Contemporaneous with these changes was an increase in algal biomass and a shift from P limitation toward more frequent N limitation of phytoplankton abundance. Particulate carbon concentrations in the late 1990s were two- to threefold greater than in the early 1980s. These trends were reflected in a larger set of Sierra Nevada lakes sampled as part of synoptic surveys (n = 28). Between 1985 and 1999, nitrate decreased and total P increased in >70% of the lakes sampled. Our data suggest that lakes throughout the Sierra Nevada are experiencing measurable eutrophication in response to the atmospheric deposition of nutrients. Additional publication details Nutrient enrichment and criteria Nutrient enrichment and criteria Nuisance plant growth is noted in streams across the nation because of elevated concentrations of nutrients. In fact, concentrations of phosphorus exceeded the USEPA desired goal for phosphorus for preventing nuisance plant growth in streams (0.1 parts per million) in about 75 percent of agricultural and urban streams sampled by the NAWQA Program. It is difficult and premature, however, to attempt a national summary of the effects of eutrophication because methodologies are limited for deriving criteria based only on nutrient concentrations. In recognition of these limitations, USEPA, in collaboration with USGS and other federal agencies, and state agencies, is developing a strategy to evaluate aquatic plant growth and to develop an understanding of stream nutrient dynamics, stream habitat (including shading and temperature), turbidity, and algal-growth processes. We will work with states and tribes to develop a methodology for deriving criteria, as well as developing criteria where data are available, for nitrogen and phosphorus runoff for lakes, rivers, and estuaries by the year 2000. We intend to develop such criteria on a regional basis using scientifically defensible data and analysis of nutrients, such as those available from the USGS. We will assist states and tribes in adopting numerical nutrient criteria as water-quality standards by the end of 2003 (Robert Cantilli, Nutrients Criteria Coordinator, USEPA, U.S. Geological Survey Circular 1225 , 1999). NAWQA also works with individual states on nutrient standards and criteria. State of Louisiana�USGS works with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality to develop nutrient criteria using NAWQA information on chlorophyll a in the Acadian-Pontchartrain Basins. According to Louisiana Department officials, ""The largest, most consistent source of chlorophyll a data for Louisiana comes from NAWQA sites.� State of Texas�NAWQA data for nutrients collected in the Trinity River Basin are used by the Trinity River Authority to develop nutrient criteria for streams. Factors affecting nutrient enrichment NAWQA information is used to assess factors affecting eutrophication, both regionally and locally. Mississippi River Basin and the Gulf of Mexico� NAWQA scientists participate in a multi-agency effort, coordinated by the White House Committee on Environmental Natural Resources (CENR), to assess nutrient enrichment, eutrophication, and the effects of hypoxia (low oxygen conditions) in the Gulf of Mexico. Specifically, NAWQA is modeling sources and transport of nutrients using a spatially referenced computer model throughout the Mississippi River watershed. The model tracks the sources (including point sources, fertilizer, livestock wastes, nonagricultural land, and atmospheric deposition) and movement of nutrients in individual stream reaches across the watershed. The effort has demonstrated key roles that hydrology and natural processes play in the transport of nutrients to, and eutrophication in, the Gulf of Mexico. Specifically, closer proximity of nitrogen sources to large streams and rivers increases the transport of nutrients to the Gulf. This is because nitrogen is not removed as readily in the large streams and rivers by natural processes as in the smaller tributaries and is, therefore, much more likely to reach a coastal area if it originates close to a larger river. As a result, some watersheds in the Mississippi River Basin are much more significant contributors of nitrogen to the Gulf of Mexico than others, despite similar nitrogen sources or similar distances from the Gulf. State of North Carolina�NAWQA findings are used by the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources to help control excessive nutrients and resulting algal blooms, fish kills, and Pfiesteria incidents in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico Rivers. For example, the findings led to the implementation of buffers in the Neuse River, which proved to effectively reduce nutrient runoff to the surface water. In addition, NAWQA research on the role of organic matter in streambed sediment in removing nitrate from groundwater in some areas of the Coastal Plain has allowed the State to prioritize its efforts in streams where elevated nitrate is not as easily removed under natural conditions. The St. Croix National Scenic Riverway (NSR) was established in 1968 under the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. In the early 1990�s continued development and usage of the St. Croix River concerned water resource managers about the impact on water quality. Research from the NAWQA Program provided evidence that nutrient loading from the tributaries was increasing the rate of eutrophication in Lake St. Croix, a sink of the St. Croix River Basin. In response to these threats, a cooperative agreement was signed in 1993 by the National Park Service, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. To date, the partnership that was formed (St. Croix Basin Water Resources Planning Team) has relied heavily on data from NAWQA to implement a protection strategy for the St. Croix River (Pam Davis, Coordinator, St. Croix Basin Water Resource Planning Team, March 2001).","The context explicitly defines the term for nutrient enrichment of lakes as ""eutrophication.""

The Angels: Morning Stars of Creation
THE ANGELS: MORNING STARS OF CREATION
Pascal P. Parente
(Chapter One of the book ""The Angels,"" by Pascal P. Parente)
 
Pure spirits, the closest image and likeness of the Creator, were the     effect of a divine act of creation. A spirit world was produced, at once, in its fullness     and in its grandeur. When, at the word of the Almighty, light's first rays lit up the     primeval, shapeless world, still ""wrapped in a mist as in swaddling clothes,"" a     wondrous song, a joyful melody filled the new heavens with never-ending strains. The Lord     recalls these primordial times when He asks: ""Where wast thou when I laid the     foundations of the earth? . . . When the morning stars praised me together, and all the     sons of God made joyful melody.""[1] These ""sons of God,"" living witnesses     of the creation of the material universe, were our Angels, the morning stars of creation.
It is an article of faith, firmly established in Scripture and     Tradition, and clearly expressed in Christian Doctrine from the beginning, that this     spirit world, our Angels, began with time and was created by God. This traditional belief     of both the Old and the New Testament was given a more formal and solemn expression in the     fourth Lateran Council in 1215: (God) ""by his almighty power created together in the     beginning of time both creatures, the spiritual and the corporeal, namely the Angelic and     the earthly, and afterwards the human, as it were an intermediate creature, composed of     body and spirit.""[2]
From this definition we learn that the Angelic spirits were created when     time began and not from eternity. Like all other creatures they were produced by the     almighty power of God, out of nothing. It would be heretical to affirm that the Angels are     an emanation of the divine substance.[3] Spiritual substances do not divide or split or     multiply in any form whatever, nor change one into another; their individual existence can     only be explained by creation.
The creation of the Angels is implicitly affirmed in all those passages     of Sacred Scripture in which it is stated that all things were made by God; explicitly and     formally their creation is mentioned by Saint Paul in one of those incomplete enumerations     of the Angelic orders: ""In Him (the Son of God, the Logos) were all things created in     heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether Thrones, or Dominations, or     Principalities, or Powers: all things were created by Him and in Him.""[4]
Creation itself is a revealed truth, not so the exact time when the     Angels were created. Nothing definite can be determined on this point from Sacred     Scripture. Neither Jewish nor Christian Tradition agrees on the time when the spirit     world, our Angels, came into existence. With many of the Fathers of the Church we believe     as very probable that the Angels were created long before the material world. They were     certainly created before man, because we find them already distinguished as good Angels     and fallen angels on man's first appearance on earth.[5]
This circumstance would seem to imply that a long time, one or more     cosmic period, had elapsed from the time of their creation. It does not seem probable that     God, Who created this world for His own glory, would have no created intelligences to     witness the awe-inspiring act of its making. The passage from Job quoted above seems to     prove that such witnesses did exist. They saw the marvelous manifestations of the Divine     Wisdom, Power, and Goodness and praised the Lord, filling the heavens with ""joyful     melody."" Man himself was not there at the beginning of creation to give glory to God;     some created intelligence must have been present. The Angels were the first splendors     created to reflect the glory of the Eternal. The first creative act must have produced a     creature to the image and similitude of God, a creature able to understand, love, thank,     and praise God. When the whole material world had been created, the Lord formed another     similar creature, ""a little less than the Angels,"" consisting of body and spirit, able to know, love, and serve Him on earth as the Angels do in heaven. We like to     imagine the creation of the material universe placed between the creations of two orders     of rational beings. One, heavenly, purely spiritual: the Angels; one, earthly, partly     material, partly spiritual: Man.[6]

The Ghost Nebula, a reflection nebula in Cepheus
Image Credit & Copyright: Adam Block/Mount Lemmon SkyCenter/University of Arizona ( http://www.caelumobservatory.com/index.html )
With this cosmic ghost I’m wishing you all a happy and spooky Halloween!
The Ghost Nebula (designated Sharpless 2-136 (Sh2-136) and vdB 141) is a rather isolated reflection nebula over 2 light-years across, located some 1200 light-years away at the edge of the Cepheus Flare molecular cloud complex in the constellation Cepheus.
It is nicknamed the “Ghost Nebula” due its spooky appearance and to several human-like figures with arms raised, rising up from the top of the cloud structure to the left of the bright reflection.
The complex process of star formation create dust clouds of many shapes and sizes. In the case of the Ghost nebula, spooky shapes seem to haunt this starry expanse drifting through the night. Of course, these shapes are also cosmic dust clouds. Several stars are embedded in the nebula, and their light gives it a ghoulish brown color.
Also cataloged as Bok globule CB230, the core of the dark cloud on the right side of this image is collapsing and is likely a binary star system in the early stages of formation, identified as BD+67 1300.
Bok globules are dark clouds of dense cosmic dust and gas within star-forming regions in which usually star formation takes place. They most commonly result in the formation of double or multiple star systems.
The name Sharpless comes from a catalog of 312 emission nebulae (H II regions). The first edition was published by Stewart Sharpless in 1953 with 142 objects (Sh1) and the second and final version was published in 1959 with 312 objects (Sh2). The “vdB” stands for “van den Bergh”; vdB 141 is reflection nebula number 141 in Sidney van den Bergh’s Catalog of Reflection Nebulae, created in 1966.

The Fireworks Galaxy, a spiral galaxy in Cepheus and Cygnus
Image Credit & Copyright: Adam Block/Mount Lemmon SkyCenter/University of Arizona ( http://www.caelumobservatory.com/index.html )
Today it’s my birthday, so let’s have a party… with fireworks!!
The Fireworks Galaxy (also known as NGC 6946, Arp 29, or Caldwell 12) is an intermediate spiral galaxy of about 20,000 light-years across, located just some 10 million light-years away, on the border between the constellations of Cepheus and Cygnus, and is moving away from us at approximately 45 kilometers per second.
The galaxy is undergoing a tremendous burst of star formation with no obvious cause. In many cases spirals light up when interacting with another galaxy, but this galaxy appears relatively isolated in space. An explanation for the high star formation rate is the recent accretion of many primordial low-mass neutral hydrogen clouds from the surrounding region.
The center of the Fireworks galaxy is home to a nuclear starburst itself, and picturesque dark dust lanes are seen lacing the disk, and it has widespread high-velocity clouds associated with the disk. The colors of the galaxy change from the yellowish light of old stars in the center to young, bright blue star clusters and reddish star-forming regions along its spiral arms. has widespread high-velocity clouds associated with the disc

The Primary Colors
 
The primary colors of light are red, green, and blue. 
Red, blue, and green are the primary colors of light. Mixing these colors can produce all of the colors of the spectrum.
 
The   Complementary Colors
The complementary colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow which are formed by combining the two adjacent primary colors. Red and blue make magenta, blue and green make cyan, and red and green make yellow.
The   Color Wheel
The primary and complementary colors combine to make the Color Wheel. Clockwise from the top the colors are: yellow, green, cyan, blue, magenta and red. On the Color Wheel, harmonizing colors are adjacent. Contrasting colors are separated by another color. Red and green are contracting colors. Colors that clash are opposite on the wheel - green and magenta for example.
 
The hue is the basic color that distinguishes one color from another - blue from red for example.
Saturation is the purity of hue. A saturated blue, for example, is composed only of pure blue color. Hues can become desaturated by the addition of either black (shadow) or white (light). Adding light makes the color more pale, producing a tint. Adding black, by covering the color with a shadow, gives a shade. In the diagram below the center wheel has pure fully saturated color. As you move to the left black is added to produce shades. As you move to the right white is added to produce tints.
The luminance of a color is the characteristic we describe when we say a color is light or dark.

PS C:\> “{0:F3}” -f [math]::PI 3.142 Pi, a Very Special Number : nrich.maths.org Pi, a Very Special Number Stage: 2 and 3 Article by NRICH team Published February 2004,February 2011. $\pi$ is the symbol used for a special number which we call pi (pronounced ""pie""). $\pi$ comes from working with circles. $\pi$ is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. This means that you can work out $\pi$ by dividing the distance around a circle by the length of its diameter. The strange thing is that on a calculator the answer you get can only ever be approximate - that is, you can't show an exact value for pi with digits on a calculator screen or even on large pieces of paper. This has fascinated mathematicians for a very long time and they have kept trying to find ways to calculate approximations of pi that are more and more accurate. $\pi$ is needed to find the area of a circle using the formula $\pi{r}^{2}$ To work out the area of a circle you need to use an approximate value for pi (like $3.14$) then multiply that by the radius of the circle squared. For example; if the radius was $5 \; \text{cm}$, the area would be approximately $3.14 \times 5 \times 5 \times 78.5$ square centimetres. What is the value of Pi? In the Old Testament of the Bible (I Kings 7:23) it is suggested that $\pi$ is equal to $3$. The Babylonians, in about 2000 BC, use $3$ or $3 1/8$. In the ancient Rhind papyrus, the Egyptian scribe Ahmes said that $\pi$ was equal to $16/9$ squared. This calculates to $3.16049 \ldots$. Archimedes worked on the problem of finding $\pi$ by calculating the area of regular polygons, with up to $96$ sides. He decided that $\pi$ was somewhere between $310/71$ and $310/70$. In decimals this would be $3.14085 \ldots$ and $3.142857 \ldots$ (remember the decimal places keep going on and on). Over the centuries, many mathematicians, such as Ptolemy (the ancient Greek astronomer), Tsu Ch'ung-Chi (of China) and Ludolph van Ceulen (of Germany) kept trying to find more accurate values for pi using a variety of different methods. During the last few centuries people have been trying to find as many decimal places as possible so they can look for patterns in the long string of digits. In 1949 a computer was used to calculate pi to $2\;037$ places. In 1967 in France $500\;000$ digits were found. In 1983 a Japanese team found $16\;777\;216$ decimal places for pi. The current record is about $51$ billion decimal places. Here are some of the decimal places that have been found: $$\pi = 3.14159 \; 26535 \; 89793 \; 23846 \; 26433 \; 83279 \; 50288 \; 41972 \; \dots$$ To help remember these digits, people like to make up sentences or rhymes, called mnemonics. For example, ""May I have a large container of coffee?"" is quite a famous one for the first eight digits. You work out the numbers by counting the letters in each word. Here's one for the first 31 digits: [...]","The context explicitly states that using Windows PowerShell, the value of Pi to three decimal places is displayed as 3.142.

But it is in stark contrast to the more serious messages of the runner-up ad and third place army recruitment poster.
In second place to the sexy bra ad was the Conservative Party's 'Labour Isn't Working' campaign by advertising agency Saatchi and Saatchi which depicted a dole queue to highlight rising unemployment figures.
The ad was considered influential in helping Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party sweep to victory in the 1979 General Election.

Copied: The 'Your Country Needs You' army recruitment poster featuring Lord Kitchener was voted the third most eye-catching despite being devised almost a century ago
In third place was Lord Kitchener's army recruitment poster dating back to World War One.
The immediate impact of the poster has seen it copied for almost a century since its first use in 1914.
More than 10,000 votes were cast to identify the most striking images to feature in the Outdoor Hall Of Fame, launched in conjunction with ad industry magazine Campaign.
Mike Baker, chief executive of the Outdoor Media Centre, said: 'It's great to see those great iconic images from the past rubbing shoulders with recent advertising work in the public's affections.'
Others  in the top ten include the Health Education Council’s Pregnant Man from  1969, an Araldite glue advert from 1983, Apple’s Silhouettes in 2003,  Beanz Meanz Heinz from 1966 and the Greenpeace Dumb Animals poster from  1984.

853 mins ( Jens Lehmann )
Achieved over 3 seasons from 2004-05 through the whole of 2005-06 and ending in the last minute of his first match of 2006-07 .  Lehmann conceded in the 3-1 loss to Bayern_Munich that put us out at the first knockout stage in the first of these seasons, but kept a clean sheet in the return leg . He was suspended for the first 2 matches of the following season (in both of which, his stand-in  Manuel Almunia did concede), then returned to become part of the  record-breaking defence that kept 10 clean sheets in a row in the 2005-06 season. It ended with Hamburg's consolation goal in the first match of the group stage on 13/09/2006 , Lehmann having again missed the first 2 games (the qualifying round matches against Dinamo Zagreb) through suspension. The suspension had been accrued thanks to  Jens' early sending off  in the 2006 final which was lost to 2 goals scored while Manuel Almunia was, again, standing in.
Previously, the record had been held by Edwin van der Sar, back when he was playing for Ajax before moving to the Premiership with Fulham . His record of 658 minutes  fell to Lehmann 6 minutes  into the second leg of the semi-final , against Villarreal on 25th April 2006.
Longest unbeaten away sequence in English league football: 27
Starting with a 1-all draw at Villa on 5th April 2003, add the remaining 3 away games of that season , the whole of the next season (another 19 matches), and the first 4 away games of 2004-05. The run was ended by the 2-0 defeat at Old Trafford on 24th October 2004.
The previous Premiership record was 23, also by Arsenal,  spanning the whole of the 2001-2002 season ,  and into 2002/03 , ended with the 2-1 loss at Everton on 19th October 2002
This is an English league (as well as top-flight and Premiership) record.  Before Wenger's Arsenal, the record was 22,  set by Nottingham Forest  (Nov 1977 to Dec 1978)
Longest unbeaten home sequence in Premiership: 33
The sequence started with the last home game of 2002-03,  included all 19 of 2003-04, and continued into  2004-05 up  to the 4-2 loss to Man Utd on 1st February. This beat our own previous record  set in 1997-1999, starting with a win over Leicester on Boxing Day 1997 (thanks to  a bizarre own goal by Steve Walsh), lasting through the whole of the 1998-99 season ,  to  a 2-1 win over Leicester on 7th August 1999, and ended  by a 2-1 defeat to Man Utd on 22nd August.
The top-flight and overall English league record is a bit further off.  Between January 1978 and January 1981, Liverpool went 63 home league  games without losing!
Fewest defeats in top-flight English season: 0
The unbeaten 2003-2004 season set a new standard for consistency at the top level of English football.

God save our gracious Queen
Long live our noble Queen,
God save the Queen:
A complete guide to God Save The Queen – Royal Central
Getting to know Timothy Laurence
As a royalist, I feel having a national anthem about our Queen is a fantastic thing. Republicans argue (they always do) that God Save The Queen shouldn’t be Britain’s anthem because it’s ‘all about The Queen’ – we’ll come onto why that’s not the case in just a minute, though I thought I’d take this opportunity to go back a few centuries to see how the song (and then anthem) came into existence.
In 1745, the patriotic song God Save The King was performed in London for the first time. The lyrics, rather different to what we know as God Save The Queen these days, but the tune – unmistakably that of the anthem.
The song was actually written as a rallying cry around the King after the defeat of his army at Prestopans by that of the ‘Young Pretender’ – Charles Edward Stuart, now more commonly known as Bonnie Prince Charlie.
Starting in a theatre in London, before spreading to others across the country, the practice of playing God Save The King at the end of performances became de rigueur and eventually the tune was adopted as the official national anthem of Great Britain.
To this day the tune remains the anthem of the United Kingdom and also of some of the other realms with Her Majesty as Head of State.
The tune to God Save The King even forms the basis to some other countries’ national songs including America’s My Country is of Thee, The Norwegian Royal Anthem and even the national anthem of Liechtenstein!
The anthem has moved with the times and in 1952, (as in 1837) was modified from God Save The King to God Save The Queen, on Her Majesty’s accession to the throne – ever since she has doubtless heard it thousands of times, yet the only one she was apparently genuinely moved by was Benjamin Britten’s rendition of the anthem, first played in the 1960s and played annually at Last Night of the Proms (below).
Nowadays, despite no official record of the anthem’s current verses existing, through tradition and persistence of use, 6 verses have been ‘adopted’ as the de facto official anthem (see below).
Typically, only the first verse is sung though on occasion a second verse may be sung (when two verses are sung, it’s verses 1 and 3) and on rare occasions, all of the first three verses may be used. Almost never are any of the other 3 verses used.
In fact, most Britons know the first verse and part of the second verse, though as a general rule that’s enough to get by on most occasions – the anthem is quite slow in comparison to other nations’ anthems, so typically just the first verse is used because of this.
Two verses are used in the presence of Her Majesty usually.
Verse 6 holds a special place with the national anthem in that it can never be used. References to ‘crushing Scots’ are to blame for the neglect of this verse.

At street parties all over Britain, along the Thames and on the Mall, the national anthem was sung with lung-bursting enthusiasm over the Jubilee weekend.
But while many embarked on the first verse with confidence, the second verse saw mumbling, miming and humming breaking out across the country.
During the Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul’s Cathedral on Tuesday, Prime Minister David Cameron was one of the few guests able to sing the second verse from memory.

qz_188,"What type of acid is extracted from the juice of lemons, oranges, limes, and grapefruit?",Citric acid,"Citrus fruits, such as grapefruit, contain citric acid. The exact amount of citric acid in one grapefruit will depend on a number of factors, most importantly the size of the fruit itself. By weight, grapefruits provide more citric acid than oranges but less than lemons or limes. Citric Acid Content. Grapefruit juice contains about 25 grams of citric acid per liter, or 1,000 grams, of juice, according to a study published in the ""Journal of Endourology"" in March 2008. Each small grapefruit contains about 182 grams of juice, which means it has approximately 5 grams of citric acid. A medium grapefruit has about 233 grams of juice, so it provides approximately 6 grams of citric acid, and a large grapefruit contains about 302 grams of juice and provides approximately 8 grams of citric acid.

Citrus fruits include lemon, lime, orange, tangerine, key lime, Clementine, grapefruit, kumquat and others.

How many dominoes are in a standard set?
A:
Quick Answer
There are a total of 28 dominoes in a standard set where the maximum number is six on each side, called a double-six set. Each domino is called a tile and the dots found on each of the tiles are called pips. For the standard 28-domino set, there are a total of 168 pips or dots.
Full Answer
Alternative names for the tiles are bones, cards, tickets, stones and spinners. Each domino is usually rectangular with a line dividing each side. Dominoes date back to the 13th century or earlier and were mentioned in writings from Chinese author Zhou Mi who mentioned dominoes, or ""pupai,"" being sold by street vendors.
There are many different ways to play dominoes. The blocking game is the most common game for two players using a double-six set. The tiles are shuffled, each player draws seven and one player plays his or her first tile. Each player then extends the line of play with a tile from their hands. The game ends when one player plays all of their tiles or when the game is blocked due to the lack of plays available. If it becomes blocked, the player that blocks it receives all of the player points.
The formula for how many tiles are in a set is ((n+1)(n+2))/2, where n is the highest number found on a tile. A double-nine set of tiles contains a total of 55 tiles, a double-twelve set of tiles contains 91 tiles.

How many pieces are in a domino set?
A:
Quick Answer
A typical set of Western-style dominoes has 28 pieces. The individual members of the set are called bones, pieces, men, stones or cards. Every piece is a rectangle of wood, bone or plastic with a pattern of dots or a blank face at each end.
Full Answer
Domino dots are usually arranged like the spots on a die, ranging in number from one to six, although some domino sides are blank. A version of the game goes back at least as far as 10th-century China; however, the modern Western variation probably appeared during the 1700s in Italy and France. The goal of the game is to achieve the highest score by positioning the stones to match numbers or reach a certain sum.
There are 28 pieces in a standard set of dominoes
There are 28 pieces in a standard set of dominoes.   Each domino has two numbers on its face.
The two numbers on 21 of the tiles differ.  These are referred to as singles or singletons.
The other 7 tiles repeat the same number twice on their faces.  These are the doubles or doublets.  In the figure below the 7 doublets comprise the right-most column.
The piece in the set with the most total dots is the 6-6 doublet, so sometimes a standard set of dominoes is called a 6-6 set.

How Many Dominoes are in a Set?
By Kristen May
Adrián González de la Peña/Demand Media
Dominoes have a long history as playing pieces for a variety of games, and they come in sets of many sizes. The size of the domino set depends on the largest number of dots, or pips, appearing on one side of the domino. A set of dominoes will have anywhere from 28 to 190 pieces.
History
Adrián González de la Peña/Demand Media
Most evidence points to dominoes having been created by the Chinese, some time before A.D. 1120, when the official invention is credited to a statesman who presented a set of dominoes to Emperor Hui Tsung.
European dominoes, which are the variety most commonly found today, were probably introduced around or before the early 18th century. They moved from Italy to France, Great Britain and beyond.

History of the Golden Globes

The first awards presentation for distinguished achievements in the film industy granted by Hollywood Foreign Correspondents Association - the precursor of today's Hollywood Foreign Press Association - took place in early 1944 with an informal ceremony at 20th Century Fox. There, Jennifer Jones was awarded Best Actress honors for The Song of Bernadette, which also won for Best Film, while Paul Lukas took home Best Actor laurels for Watch on the Rhine. Awards were presented in the form of scrolls.
The following year, the members of the association held a contest to find a design for a statuette that would best represent the overall aims of the organization. Marina Cisternas, president of the group in 1945-46, presented the idea fof a shiny globe on a cylindrical pedestal, to represent the world,.
In conjunction with the Golden Globes presentation, the Hollywood Foreign Correspondents Association held its first gala social event in 1945 with a formal banquet at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Going My Way won for Best Picture, while Ingrid Bergman and Alexander Knox were named Best Actress and Best Actor for their performances in The Bells of St. Mary and President Wilson, respectively.
There have been other important landmarks in the history of the Golden Globes. In 1951 the association decided to divide the best film, actor and actress nominees into two categories -- drama, and musical or comedy -- so that no genre would be slighted. In 1952, the HFPA created the Cecil B. DeMille Award to recognize “outstanding contribution to the entertainment field.” The award’s first recipient was DeMille himself.
Clockwise from top: Julie Andrews, Gene Kelly, Laurence Harvey, World Favorites 1968; World Favorite Kim Novak, 1957; Newcomer Jayne Mansfield, 1957.

Other unique awards that have been discontinued over the years were the World Film Favorite, from 1951 to 1980 and the Newcomer Award, which had several different names during its lifespan from 1948 to 1983. Timothy Hutton, Bette Midler and Diana Ross were among the distinguished Newcomers, and Steve McQueen, Doris Day and Barbra Streisand were some of the World Film Favorites.
In 1956 the Golden Globes included some unique categories: the Trailblazer Award to Walt Disney (American story-telling), Dinah Shore (American song), Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz (American comedy). The latter paved the way for the inclusion of television categories alongside motion pictures, a tradition that remains to this day.
In 1957 five TV shows received Golden Globes: Cheyenne ( best American western); Mickey Mouse Club (best American children’s show); Matinee Theatre ( best American daytime theatre); Playhouse 90 ( best nighttime theatre); This Is Your Life (best audience participation show).
The current Foreign Language category has its roots in the Samuel Goldwyn International award which distinguished non-US pictures from 1959 to 1964 - Greece's Never on Sunday, Germany's The Mark and Italy's Divorce,Italian Style were some of the recipients of the Samuel Goldwyn Award.
Some categories, however, did not make it to present day's Globes. From 1948 to 1963 the Globes recognized achievements in cinematography. From 1951 on separate cinematograhy Globes were awarded to black and white and color pictures. The Longest Day, High Noon and On The Waterfront received the former, while Quo Vadis, Lawrence of Arabia and Brigadoon were among the winner in the color category. Another category that was briefly active was the Golden Globe for Best Documentary, presented from 1973 to 1977 - Elvis on Tour and Walls of Fire were the two winners in 1973.
In 2007 a new category was introduced: Best Animated Feature Film. The first year's nominees were Cars, Happy Feet and Monster House, with Pixar's Cars taking the Globe.
Today, the Golden Globes recognize achievements in 25 categories; 14 in motion pictures and 11 in television. January 10 2016 will mark the 73rd presentation of the Golden Globe Awards.

Being buried alive might be a bit common. � Creature read in a Book that they were having a funeral service for a Greek Bishop in his church and the Bishop was lying in state in the church. � And suddenly the Bishop sat up and said to the congregation Wot is you all staring at?
Another time the congregation was singing a funeral hymn in a church, and a voice from inside the coffin joined in the chorus.
And here another wot I think is true. � Creature had a friend from County Roscommon. � Over there the corpse lies in bed and everybody goes into the bedroom to pay their respects and say a prayer. � Peter and his friend were on opposite sides of the bed of an old lady wot bent double by arthritis in life. � But she was flat on her back in bed. � Not for long when the naughty boys had undone the buckles of the belt wot kept her strapped down. � You never saw a room empty so fast when the dead old biddy sat up.
And if it not true, it ought to be!  
The first part of an autopsy consists of identifying the decedent, recording the weight and length of the body, describing the appearance of the body from head to toe and back to front, and then detailing the physical signs consistent with death.
Usually, this is a second time the person is declared dead, and done quite scientifically.
Maybe the funeral parlor undertaker can get away with murder, but the pathologist cannot, unless he confabulates the details of his autopsy.  
I was under the impression that the purpose of a post mortem (autopsy) was to determine the cause of death rather than confirm that it had occurred.
But I have also heard of rigor mortis causing a body to sit up, which I imagine would be quite unnerving the first time it is seen.","The context explicitly states that Taphephobia is the fear of being buried alive, not losing your teeth.

The picture below illustrates the Hebrew alphabet, in Hebrew alphabetical order. Note that Hebrew is written from right to left, rather than left to right as in English, so Alef is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet and Tav is the last.

qz_666,"What word is used to describe someone who is neither left or right handed, but can use both hands with equal ease?",Ambidextrous,"11 Facts About the Ambidextrous | Mental Floss
1. If you can write equally well with either hand, then you are the one percent . Even among the small population of ‘multi-handed’ individuals, very few experience equal ease and skill with both hands. In comparison, around 10% of people are lefties.
2. Right-, left- and mixed-handedness aren’t sufficient to define the preferences of most people, according to experts. Most people experience some level of cross-dominance — favoring one hand for certain tasks, even if it’s the non-dominant one — and among the group of people who use both hands, there are even finer distinctions. Ambidextral refers to those who can use both hands as well as a right-hander’s right hand (so, really well), and ambisinistral can be used to describe people who use both hands as well as a right-hander’s left hand (that is, somewhat clumsily).
3. Unlike righties, who show strong left brain dominance, the hemispheres of ambidextrous and left-handed people’s brains are almost symmetric...
4. ... as is the typical brain of a person with synesthesia, or “mixed senses,” who experiences cross-sensory perception. Among synesthetes, the instance of ambidexterity (and left-handedness) is much higher than in the general population.
5. The ambidextrous are more likely to possess the LRRTM1 gene (on chromosome 2), which is linked to schizophrenia. Studies reveal that people with schizophrenia are significantly more likely to be ambidextrous or left-handed than people who are not schizophrenic.
6. Another study, conducted through the BBC Science website, shows that of the one percent of 255,000 respondents who indicated equal ease writing with both hands, 9.2% of men and 15.6% of women reported being bisexual . In the same study, 4% of right-handed and 4.5% of left-handed men, and 6.2% of right-handed and 6.3% of left-handed women said they’re attracted to both sexes.
7. People who identify as ‘either-handed’ score slightly lower overall in general intelligence testing, and most often those scores are lower in arithmetic, memory and reasoning...
8. ... except when they aren’t. A study of 8000 children ages 7 and 8 shows that the 87 mixed-handed students had more pronounced difficulties in language skills, and at ages 15 and 16, the same students showed a higher risk of ADHD symptoms and performed academically under both right- and left-handed students from the same sample.
9. Ambis can be quick to anger, according to a study from Merrimack College, which suggests a higher interlinking of brain hemispheres found in ambidextrous and lefties. A follow-up study found that the increased hemisphere connections correlate to increased awkwardness, clumsiness and moodiness.
10. But inconsistent-handers can also be easier to sway emotionally . Montclair State University tested a group of right- left and either-handers for emotional stability. Their findings report that of the group, righties were hardest to coerce, and ambis were most likely to report a change in mood based on their surroundings, directed thought, and music.
11. It’s not all bad news for the handedness-ambivalent, though. Being able to use both hands with (almost) equal ease can really pay off, especially in sports, arts and music. Some reportedly cross-dominant celebrities and historic figures include Leonardo da Vinci, Pete Rose, Richard Feynmen, pitcher Greg A. Harris, Michelle Kwan, Shigeru Miyamoto, Paul McCartney, Benjamin Franklin and Harry Truman.
hypernyms - What's the single-word for ""left or right handed""? - English Language & Usage Stack Exchange
up vote 11 down vote accepted
Another option would be hand-dominance or hand-dominancy as a single word. It is not as common as handedness and I usually see it in medical contexts. (It is usually in two words but you can hyphenate to form a hyphenated compound noun).
Research shows that hand dominancy can be an important feature affecting one's tolerance of pain. According to a 2009 Israeli study from the University of Haifa, right-handed people are more tolerant of pain than left-handed individuals.

Top 10 Pub Names in the UK
Posted on: April 7th, 2011 by chrish
Each week we get the odd email from various media outlets asking us some strange questions for whatever article they are currently writing. Time upon time, we get asked ‘What is the most popular pub name in the UK?’ We thought we’d share with you what they are – is your local named the same?
(Some of them might be proceeded with ‘The’ – lots of pubs go by with and without it!)

The Most Popular Pub Names
Release Notes
By Ross Lawley, MongoEngine maintainer and Scala Engineer at 10gen
Earlier in the year I gave a talk at MongoDB London about the different aggregation options with MongoDB. The topic recently came up again in conversation at a user group, so I thought it deserved a blog post.
Gathering ideas for the talk
I wanted to give a more interesting aggregation talk than the standard “counting words in text”, and as the aggregation framework gained shiny 2dsphere geo support in 2.4 , I figured I’d use that. I just needed a topic…
What is top of mind for us Brits?
Two things immediately sprang to mind: weather and beer.
I opted to focus on something close to my heart: beer :) But what to aggregate about beer? Then I remembered an old pub quiz favourite…
What is the most popular pub name in the UK?
I know there is some great open data, including a wealth of information on pubs available from the awesome open street map project. I just need to get at it and happily the Overpass-api provides a simple “xapi” interface for OSM data. All I needed was anything tagged with amenity=pub within in the bounds of the UK and with their xapi interface this is as simple as a wget:
http://www.overpass-api.de/api/xapi?* [amenity=pub][bbox=-10.5,49.78,1.78,59]
Once I had an osm file I used the imposm python library to parse the xml and then convert it to following GeoJSON format:
{   ""_id"" : 451152,   ""amenity"" : ""pub"",   ""name"" : ""The Dignity"",   ""addr:housenumber"" : ""363"",   ""addr:street"" : ""Regents Park Road"",   ""addr:city"" : ""London"",   ""addr:postcode"" : ""N3 1DH"",   ""toilets"" : ""yes"",   ""toilets:access"" : ""customers"",   ""location"" : {       ""type"" : ""Point"",       ""coordinates"" : [-0.1945732, 51.6008172]   } }
Then it was a case of simply inserting it as a document into MongoDB. I quickly noticed that the data needed a little cleaning, as I was seeing duplicate pub names, for example: “The Red Lion” and “Red Lion”. Because I wanted to make a wordle I normalised all the pub names.
If you want to know more about the importing process, the full loading code is available on github: osm2mongo.py
Top pub names
It turns out finding the most popular pub names is very simple with the aggregation framework. Just group by the name and then sum up all the occurrences. To get the top five most popular pub names we sort by the summed value and then limit to 5:
db.pubs.aggregate([   {""$group"":      {""_id"": ""$name"", ""value"": {""$sum"": 1}      }   },   {""$sort"": {""value"": -1}},   {""$limit"": 5} ]);
For the whole of the UK this returns:
The Red Lion
The White Horse
Top pub names near you
At MongoDB London I thought that was too easy, so filtered to find the top pub names near the conference and showing off some of the geo functionality that became available in MongoDB 2.4. To limit the result set match and ensure the location is within a 2 mile radius by using $centreSphere. Just provide the coordinates [ <long>, <lat> ] and a radius of roughly 2 miles (3959 is approximately the radius of the earth, so divide it by 2):
db.pubs.aggregate([     { ""$match"" : { ""location"":                  { ""$within"":                    { ""$centerSphere"": [[-0.12, 51.516], 2 / 3959] }}}     },     { ""$group"" :        { ""_id"" : ""$name"",          ""value"" : { ""$sum"" : 1 } }     },     { ""$sort"" : { ""value"" : -1 } },     { ""$limit"" : 5 }   ]);
What about where I live?
At the conference I looked the most popular pub name near the conference. Thats great if you happen to live in the centre of London but what about everyone else in the UK? So for this blog post I decided to update the demo code and make it dynamic based on where you live.
See: pubnames.rosslawley.co.uk
Apologies for those outside the UK - the demo app doesn’t have data for the whole world - its surely possible to do.
Cheers

List of Single Word Palindromes

Single Word Palindromes
On this page I've collected a comprehensive list of single word palindromes.
In the spirit of 'single word' I've decided to exclude from this list any palindromic phrases, proper nouns, or hyphenated forms, even though you will encounter these sorts of palindromes in crosswords and other puzzles from time to time.
Unfortunately, this policy means that my page must omit some palindromic gems, like...
AMANAPLANACANALPANAMA — probably the most oft' quoted palindrome of all time, but a phrase nonetheless,
MALAYALAM — the Dravidian language of Kerala, and hence a proper noun, and
RACECAR — a neat word, but strictly a hyphenated form.
...which was, of course, just an excuse to mention them after all ;-)
On the other hand, a pleasant result of these strict criteria is that every word in the list is allowed in Scrabble ! Well, if your adjudicator is the Official International Scrabble Dictionary at least.
Finally, since palindromes of four letters or less are a dime a dozen, I've only included words that are at least five letters long.
And all this banter leaves us with the following single word palindromes...
ALULA
From SEMEME, a unit of meaning.
ROTAVATOR
A soil-tilling machine.
And if you've got a soft spot for palindromes, you'll probably get a giggle out of this brilliant sketch...
Finally, if strange little words like these get your motor running, you'll get a real buzz out of my free book of short words. And you'll start to kick serious butt on the Scrabble board too!

Fruit and vegetables
    Many Egyptians had a garden adjacent to their house, where they grew vegetables and fruit.  Vegetables - the ""crop of the year"" - were grown all year round, irrigated by hand and formed an important part of their diet.
    May the king give an offering (to) Osiris, the great god, that he may grant an invocation offering of bread, beer, cattle, fowl, and every good and pure thing, every kind of vegetable...

Vegetables
    How basic vegetables were on the ordinary Egyptian's menu can be seen in this complaint of striking workers during the reign of Ramses III
    We are starving hungry. Our tongue wasted away in thirst. No cloth is left. We are lacking oil. We have no fish, not even vegetables.
    Onions, which celibate priests were forbidden to eat because of their aphrodisiacal effects, were a staple food.
    On the pyramid (of Cheops) it is declared in Egyptian writing how much was spent on radishes and onions and leeks for the workmen, and if I rightly remember that which the interpreter said in reading to me this inscription, a sum of one thousand six hundred talents of silver was spent;
Herodotus, Histories II, Project Gutenberg
    Garlic was highly valued. According to Pliny Garlic and onions are invoked by the Egyptians , when taking an oath, in the number of their deities. Ramses III ordered garlic to be distributed in large quantities in the temples. The Israelites who had become accustomed to the Egyptian diet of bread, fish and vegetables, complained when they were wandering in the desert [ 3 ]
    5   We remember the fish , which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick.
Numbers 11
    Leeks [ 6 ] are also mentioned in the Ebers papyrus and in the Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor the narrator found all kinds of food on his deserted island:
    When I grew hungry and looked about for food, I found all ready for me within easy reach: figs and grapes, all manner of good herbs, berries and grain, melons of all kinds, fishes and birds for the taking.
Egyptian melon, faience
Middle Kingdom
Source: Keimer, op.cit
    Radishes, choriander, cabbages, endive [ 7 ], cucumbers,  watermelons, melons [ 13 ] and raphanus, a wild  radish tasting like turnip, were grown widely. According to Athenaeus the Egyptians ate boiled cabbage before all the rest of the food considering it one of the most delicate vegetables. The tubercular Arum colocasia, one of the plants loosely referred to as lotus, was also relished [ 5 ]. Mallow was added to soups [ 12 ].
    The poor ate the roots of papyrus and other plants gathered in the marshes. The lotos mentioned by Herodotus with its round root was possibly the White Lotus .
    When the river has become full and the plains have been flooded, there grow in the water great numbers of lilies, which the Egyptians call lotos; these they cut with a sickle and dry in the sun, and then they pound that which grows in the middle of the lotos and which is like the head of a poppy, and they make of it loaves baked with fire. The root also of this lotos is edible and has a rather sweet taste: it is round in shape and about the size of an apple.
Herodotus, Histories II, 2.92
Project Gutenberg
    A second 'lily' variety Herodotus describes was probably the Sacred Lotus , Nelumbo nucifera, an import from India, and not the traditionally depicted blue lotus.
    There are other lilies too, in flower resembling roses, which also grow in the river, and from them the fruit is produced in a separate vessel springing from the root by the side of the plant itself, and very nearly resembles a wasp's comb: in this there grow edible seeds in great numbers of the size of an olive-stone, and they are eaten either fresh or dried. Besides this they pull up from the fens the papyrus which grows every year, and the upper parts of it they cut off and turn to other uses, but that which is left below for about a cubit in length they eat or sell: and those who desire to have the papyrus at its very best bake it in an oven heated red-hot, and then eat it.

John Sullivan wrote the theme music for Only Fools and Horses when he wrote the first series, but the producers opted instead for an instrumental, saxophone-led tune composed by Ronnie Hazlehurst, who had also arranged the themes for other BBC sit-coms, such as Yes Minister and Last of the Summer Wine. However, Sullivan was unhappy with this, so for the second series he persuaded the BBC to use his own compositions instead, partly because the new lyrics would explain the obscure title, which had been the subject of viewers' questions to the BBC during the first series.
The first series was subsequently re-edited to use the new theme songs, though the first episode, ""Big Brother"", is still sometimes repeated with the original Hazlehurst music intact, as is the 1981 Christmas special. The current DVD release of Series One, however, replaces the theme music on all seven episodes. The original theme music is still used in the first episode during a montage in which Del unsuccessfully conducts business throughout Peckham whilst trying to find Rodney.
The lyrics to the established themes contain both slang and references to British culture, and describe elements of the show. The opening lyrics include ""stick a pony in my pocket"", pony being London slang for 25 pounds sterling;[58] ""fetch the suitcase from the van"" and ""where it all comes from is a mystery"", all references to the Trotters' shady, cash-only business. It ends with the title lyric, ""why do only fools and horses work?"" The closing theme follows suit, describing the dubious goods that the Trotters specialise in, from ""miles and miles of carpet tiles"" to ""Trevor Francis tracksuits""; Francis was an English football player during the 1970s and 1980s. These are ""from a mush in Shepherd's Bush""; mush is slang for a man whose name is unknown and Shepherd's Bush is a West London district.The line ""no income tax, no VAT"" summarises their outlook, before closing with the refrain ""God bless Hooky Street"". Hooky is British slang for something stolen or which has been acquired illegally. The images peeling away was conceived as a metaphor for the Trotters' lifestyle
Both songs are performed by Sullivan, and not – as is sometimes thought – by Nicholas Lyndhurst.Sullivan had intended for Chas & Dave to sing it, since they were an act associated with Cockney-style music, but they were unavailable having just recorded a hit record with ""Ain't No Pleasing You"", so he was persuaded to do it himself by Ray Butt.The new theme was also arranged by Hazlehurst. Chas & Dave did later contribute to the show, performing ""Down to Margate"", the closing credits song for ""The Jolly Boys' Outing"".
The opening credits see images of the three principal actors peel on and off the screen sequentially like adhesive labels. These appear over a background of still photographs of everyday life in South London, including a used car lot and a tower block. The sequence was conceived by graphic designer, Peter Clayton, as a ""metaphor for the vagaries of the Trotters' lifestyle"", whereby money was earned and quickly lost again. The action was shot manually frame by frame, and took around six weeks to complete.
As the series progressed, the sequence was occasionally updated with new footage, but it only ever featured Del, Rodney and either Grandad or Uncle Albert. The 2001–2003 trilogy featured just Del and Rodney. In total, the shots of Del and Rodney were updated three times during the series' run to reflect their ageing, whilst Grandad and Uncle Albert only ever received one version each during their run. The 2001-2003 Christmas specials used the same titles sequences but rendered for broadcast in the now standard 16:9 ratio widescreen.","The context explicitly states that the theme tune of the TV show includes the line ""Stick a pony in me pocket,"" and directly associates this with the show ""Only Fools and Horses."" The lyrics are described as part of the show's theme, and the context provides multiple confirmations of this link.",32,1,1,1,1,1,0,4752,1193,26.030216693878174,1124842447.265625

Wimbledon Mens Singles
We take a look at the mens singles competition, providing background and chances of the players for the 2011 tournament at the All England Club.
Many Tennis fans would argue that Wimbledon is the toughest of the four majors to win as it is the only one played on a grass surface. The winner must therefore be versatile in handling the different challenges that playing on grass poses. Please check here for details of the 2010 Wimbledon mens seedings .
The 2011 Men’s singles at Wimbledon promises yet again to be as exciting as ever with Roger Federer favourite in the Wimbledon mens singles betting to win the crown once again afre beating Andy Roddick last year. Nadal’s victory in 2008 prevented Federer from becoming the first man in Wimbledon history to record six straight wins, he will be back at SW19 for the first time since and desperate to regain his crown.
In some media circles Federer was being written off last year, but he came back to the top when he won the US Open Tennis for the fifth straight year, defeating Britain's Andy Murray in the final. He then lost to Nadal in the Australian Open final in another five set epic, before achieving his greatest moment in tennis, when he won the French Open title for the first time. That win gave him a record equalling fourteen Grand Slams a record he shares with, Sampras and he also became the first man since Andre Agassi to win all four Grand Slam titles.
We think that Federer should win once more this year but the following players all have chances
Robin Soderling
Fred Perry - The last British Mens Single Champion
Fred Perry was the last British mens single champion at Wimbledon when he won the title for the third and final time in 1936. Perry, had won the previous two mens singles titles at the 1934 and 1935 Championship and despite being some years ago reports suggest that he was one of the greatest ever Wimbledon champions. Can Scot, Andy Murray emulate the great man this year? Murray has been in outstanding form this year and won the the title at Queens Club last week. He has shot up to number three in the world rankings and is third favourite to win in the mens singles betting. He reached the quarter finals last year where he was beaten by Rafa Nadal. Tim Henman remains the only British player to get to the semi finals in recent years, he achieved this four times in total.
Modern Era Mens Wimbledon Champions
In recent years, some of the biggest names in mens Tennis have lifted the famous Mens Singles trophy. Four times champion Rod Laver was the first male to claim the title in the open era in 1968 and 1969. Fellow Australian John Newcombe won back to back championships in 1970 and 1971 before Bjorn Borg won four consecutive titles between 1976 - 79.
During the 80s, the Wimbledon mens singles title was won by great names such as John McEnroe, Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg, all who won the title on more than one occasion during the decade.
American great Pete Sampras dominated the title in the 90s winning the mens singles crown a total of seven times between 1993 and 2000, only Richard Krajicek stopped him from winning a Wimbledon record eight straight titles. In recent years, the mens singles game has been all about Roger Federer who has won the last four Wimbledon mens singles championships and the Swiss star shows no signs of slowing down his dominance of the mens game.

Andy Murray and the first Scot to win Wimbledon title
By Tom Hamilton BBC Scotland

They are separated by more than a century.
But Wimbledon winner Andy Murray shares much in common with the only other Scot to have won the men's singles title.
It was back in 1896 when Harold Mahony made history to triumph at SW19 in the distant days before prize money, ice baths and support teams packed with coaches, fitness advisors, nutritionists and psychologists.
Murray has now secured his place in the record books as the first British man to win the singles title in 77 years, and can also lay claim to be the first Scot to win the title wearing shorts.
For his victory, Mahony wore long white trousers which were the order of the day in the Victorian era.
However, while tennis dress code has changed dramatically in the last 117 years, the two great Scottish champions are linked by certain similarities.
Both tall men, they measure up at an identical 6ft 3in, and like Murray the young Mahony boasted terrific fitness levels.
Olympic medals
Similarly, opponents of both marvelled at the comparable never-say-die attitudes of these remarkable men, their fierce determination and overpowering will to win.
He was a formidable player, described as a mound of bone and muscle and fantastically fit
Honor Godfrey, Wimbledon Museum
In addition, both men have Olympic medals to their credit - although Mahony only won a silver medal in the men's singles event and a bronze in the doubles tournament in Paris in 1900 while Murray picked up gold in the singles at London in 2012.
Both players also spent significant amounts of their time based abroad before winning at Wimbledon.
Until recently, few had heard of Mahony or know of his remarkable exploits.
But, like all former winners of the biggest event in the tennis world, he is held in the highest regard by the All-England Club at Wimbledon.
Wimbledon Museum curator Honor Godfrey has carried out detailed research on Mahoney, who was born in Edinburgh on 13 February 1867 and raised in the city's Charlotte Square.
The curator said: ""His father was an Irish barrister and landowner. He had a home in Scotland but also lived at Drumore Castle, Country Kerry, where he had a  tennis court on which he practised and played.
""He was a formidable player, described as a mound of bone and muscle and fantastically fit, with terrific ground strokes and a wonderful backhand.
Image caption Mahony in action at the Scottish Doubles Championships at Moffat in 1899
""He was a volleyer and described by his contemporaries as someone who never ran out of steam and could run around the court all the time.""
In Mahony's day players looked radically different to those of the 21st Century.
He would have worn clothes similar to those which Fred Perry was kitted out in when he won in 1936 - long white trousers, a white shirt buttoned up, a short tie, possibly a belt at the waist or a scarf tied around his waist and topped off with a cap.
He would, of course, have also worn a blazer to arrive on court before play commenced.
Mahony's victory over fellow Briton, Wilfred Baddeley, was a five set match  -  6-2, 6-8, 5-7, 8-6, 6-3 - which established a long-standing Wimbledon record.
Ms Godfrey told BBC Radio Scotland's John Beattie: ""It was the longest match in terms of number of games - 57 - and that record was not beaten until 1954.""
She added: ""He was a happy-go-lucky player. He was very jovial, full of confidence and people enjoyed travelling with him.
Murray's victory
Image caption Andy Murray celebrates 2013 win
Wimbledon is Murray's second Grand Slam title after he won the 2012 US Open
It is the 36th time a British man has won the Wimbledon singles title - more than any other nation
Fred Perry was the last British man to win Wimbledon, completing a hat-trick of wins in 1936
Harold Mahony was the only other Scotsman to win the Wimbledon singles title - in 1896
Murray is the most successful British man in terms of Grand Slam match wins with 113, ahead of Fred Perry on 106
Fred Perry won eight Grand Slam titles - three Wimbledons, three French Opens, one US Open and one Australian Open
Murray has reached seven Grand Slam finals, behind Fred Perry on 10
""He joked with spectators and contributed enormously to the enjoyment of the game.""
Murray picked up a cheque for £1.6m when he won but Mahony did not receive a penny for his efforts.
He competed in the amateur era of gut-stringed wooden racquet and white tennis balls when no prize money was permitted.
However, he did lift the same trophy which Murray kissed and hugged with so much pride after his three set victory over Novak Djokovic.
Mahony returned to Wimbledon the following year to defend his title, but was beaten in straight sets in the final.
Murray's fans will hope that is where the similarities end when he defends his title in 2014.
Mahony died on 25 June 1905, at the age of 38, in a bicycling accident while descending a steep hill near Caragh Lake in County Kerry.
Sadly, the Wimbledon Museum only contains the basic records and fond memories of Mahony, cherished by Ms Godfrey.
There is no memorabilia on display to mark his triumph.
Ms Godfrey said: ""I can't think we have a single exhibit for him. So if there is anyone out there with memorabilia we would be very interested in hearing from them.""

Songfacts
This was the first Who song written by their bass player, John Entwistle. Pete Townshend ordered him to write a song for their second album. To encourage the band to write their own songs, their record company offered them a £500 advance if each member wrote a song on the album.
Entwistle was afraid of spiders as a kid. He wrote this about seeing a spider crawling from the ceiling and squishing it.
Entwistle wrote this as a joke, but it became a concert favorite. It is a fun song that offset many of the more serious Who songs.
This was the only song from the album that they continued to play live.
In the UK, the album was called A Quick One. It was changed to Happy Jack in the US to avoid being offensive.
After he wrote this, Entwistle started wearing a spider medallion at concerts.","The context states that John Entwistle wrote the song about seeing a spider crawling from the ceiling and squishing it, directly identifying Boris as a spider.",22,1,1,1,1,1,0,1278,396,8.797977924346924,1097288681.5429688

Answer:
Duff Beer is a fictional brand of beer in the animated series The Simpsons. It is Homer Simpson's beer of choice. It is a parody of stereotypical American mass-produced beer: poor-quality, cheap, and advertised everywhere. The beer's official spokesperson is Duffman.
The show's creators appear to have designed the Duff Beer label for the making of the May 1990 episode ""Some Enchanted Evening"". The notes ""MAKE UP BEER LABEL DUFF BEER?"" can be found>mmmmmm....Duff......uuuugggggg... (drool, drool)

Simpsons' 'Duff Beer' Will Soon Be Available to Real Life Drinkers
Duff Beer for me, Duff Beer for you
+ READ ARTICLE
21st Century Fox is brewing up a plan to make Duff Beer, Homer Simpson’s fictional drink of choice, into a real and possibly lucrative brand, the company confirmed on Friday.
“I think there’s potential to have Duff everywhere in the world,” Jeffrey Godsick, president of Fox’s consumer products division, said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.
Until recently Fox was sending cease and desist orders to any brewer that infringed on the brand, but now the media company is reportedly preparing to launch a premium lager with a “caramel aroma” and just a hint of irony. The label will not include overt references to the The Simpsons. Instead it will faithfully mimic the bottles and cans seen in the show.
Unfortunately for American Duff Beer fans, assuming they exist in the real world, the brand will only launch in Chile initially, where illegal copies of Duff Beer have already taken the market by storm. Fox could not confirm a U.S. release, but Fox executives haven’t ruled out the possibility of a domestic homecoming either.

Duff's equivalent in Shelbyville is Fudd Beer .
Moe Szyslak once tried to sell Homer a can of ""Swedish Duff"", or Düff (a fake beer that Moe made up by himself by adding the umlaut with magic marker). This is not to be confused with ""Scandinavian Düff, the Beer of Danish Kings"" [1] . He also offered ""Malaysian Duff"" [2] , which was made of soy sauce. There was also at least one variation actually from another country and also of implied high-quality called Duffenbraus, although the label stated it was ""semi-imported."" Moe supplied these to Mayor Quimby and Homer Simpson (the latter of whom had been hired as the former's bodyguard thanks to his saving his life at a riot at the Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con ) on the house when the Mayor made an unexpected visit to the Tavern, strongly implied to be to get a bribe to call off a mandatory health inspection.
When Bart , Lisa and Selma visit Duff Gardens [3] the gift shop sells Duff Beer Goggles that let you see and hear everything like a drunk. When Bart puts them on, they make Aunt Selma look and sound more attractive.
When Homer tours the Duff Brewery in "" Duffless "", a pipeline is seen splitting freshly-brewed beer into the Duff, Duff Dry and Duff Lite tanks, implying they are the same beer with different labels. The tasting room features Duff Dark, Raspberry Duff, and Tartar-Control Duff. There's also Lady Duff for women (presumably regular Duff Beer in a pink can). Duff tie-in products include a Duff Beer Suitcase, Duff ""Gummy Beers"" candy, and Duff Beer Calendars.

The Meaning of Love - Michelle McManus | Songs, Reviews, Credits | AllMusic The Meaning of Love google+ AllMusic Review                             by Sharon Mawer What makes a pop star? Or maybe the question should more accurately be ""What makes a Pop Idol?"" In 2002 the answer was obvious, it was Will Young the winner of the first series of Pop Idol in the U.K., or perhaps Gareth Gates who so very nearly won but despite only coming in second, still achieved several number one singles throughout the year. For the second series of Pop Idol, all the elements were back in place, the four judges, the ridiculous early auditions from people who couldn't hold a tune but believed they could, and eventually, ten singers going through to the live finals, televised every Saturday night during the final few months of 2003. Despite two good looking boys, Mark Rhodes and Sam Nixon ( Will and Gareth for series two), it was Michelle McManus a 23-year-old Scottish singer with a big belting voice that won the day. It wasn't so much for her vocal abilities that Michelle (known only by her first name) received all the publicity, but for her outsized weight, which was really unfair, but that's the nature of the record business, which appears to have no room for Mama Cass types in the 21st century. Whether Michelle received public telephone votes out of sympathy or whether the public really wanted to see what 19 Entertainment, the company that was scheduled to sign the winner, would do with an overweight lady as their Pop Idol, or whether they were judging her solely on her big voice, we shall never know, but on the final evening when she was announced the winner, one of the judges, Pete Waterman stormed off the set before being asked to join in the post vote celebrations claiming that this was not his idea of a Pop Idol and he would have nothing to do with it. As expected in the New Year, the song that Michelle had sung on the final show, ""All This Time"" was released as a single and shot straight to number one. One month later in February 2004, her debut album was released. Called The Meaning of Love , it reached number three but soon found its way shooting down the charts and into the bargain bins. Unfortunately the album was either rushed, or badly planned because with a voice as big as Michelle McManus ' she should have been given a set of songs to showcase her undoubted talent. She was not. The single ""All This Time"" was a sort of cross between an All Saints number and a typical charity single release while the second single, ""The Meaning of Love"" was a charity sounding record without the All Saints rhythm, without the multi-vocals, and without much of a tune either. And after these two opening tracks, the album went downhill further with 12 other songs, all over produced medium paced ballads with louder than necessary backing orchestration, drowning any emotional content that Michelle may have given to the songs, all sounding very bland, tuneless, and unmemorable and nearly all with the same key change for the final chorus. The most obvious example of blandness being the Nina Simone hit song ""Feelin' Good"" which is given a makeover here, devoid of any emotion and giving a lie to the possibility that the singer was indeed ""feeling good."" When the title track was released as a single, it only just scraped into the Top 20 and the writing was already on the wall for the Pop Idol career of Michelle McManus . If there is ever to be a next time, give her some decent material.","The context explicitly states that Michelle McManus's single ""All This Time"" was released as a single and shot straight to number one in 2004, making her the Pop Idol who had this number one hit.",35,1,1,1,1,1,0,6057,956,22.66471767425537,1112361947.1679688

Sharapova topples Williams to win Wimbledon crown
By Stephen Wilson, The Associated Press
WIMBLEDON, England  Completing an improbable journey from the far reaches of Siberia to the pinnacle of the sport, 17-year-old Maria Sharapova beat two-time defending champion Serena Williams 6-1, 6-4 Saturday to win Wimbledon for her first Grand Slam title.
Maria Sharapova never wilted in the women's final against Serena Williams, winning in straight sets for her first Grand Slam title.
By Anja Niedringhaus, AP
She's the first Russian to win a Wimbledon singles title, the third-youngest women's champion in history and, at No. 13, the lowest seeded women's winner since Wimbledon began seeding players in 1927. ""I never, never in my life expected this to happen so fast,"" Sharapova said. ""It's always been my dream to come here and to win. It was never in my mind I would do it this year.""
After Williams hit a forehand into the net to end the 73-minute match, Sharapova dropped to her knees at the baseline and covered her face with her hands. She raised her arms and walked to the net. Williams walked around the net and the two players embraced.
Sharapova pumped her fists, whacked a ball into the stands and climbed into the guest box to hug her father, Yuri. She pulled out a cell phone and tried to call her mother but couldn't get through immediately.
""I turned it on and it keeps turning off — come on, technology,"" she said with a giggle.
Sharapova accepted the winner's trophy — the Venus Rosewater dish — from the Duke of Kent.
""I want to cut up this trophy and give it to everybody, this whole crowd,"" she said.
Turning to Williams, Sharapova said, ""I have to take this trophy from you for one year. I'm sorry. ... I'm sure we're going to be here one more time and hopefully many more times in other Grand Slams and fight for the trophy.""
""It wasn't my day,"" a gracious Williams told the Centre Court crowd. ""Maria played a really good match. Congratulations on your first Grand Slam.""
Sharapova, playing in her first Grand Slam final, put on a virtuoso performance against the six-time Grand Slam winner. She showed no signs of nerves and kept Williams on the defensive, hitting 17 winners and only 11 errors. It was the most lopsided women's final since Steffi Graf beat Monica Seles 6-1, 6-2 in 1992.
""I don't know how I won,"" Sharapova said. ""I don't know what the tactics were. I was in my own little world — I don't know what that world was really.""
And she did it after coming down with a bad sore throat Friday night.
""I was in tears because I didn't think I'd be ready to play a Wimbledon final and win,"" she said.
Sharapova is the youngest woman to capture Wimbledon since Martina Hingis, who was 16 when she won in 1997. The youngest champion was Lottie Dod, who was 15 when she won the 1887 title.
Sharapova halted Williams' bid to become only the third woman in 35 years to win three consecutive titles. She also ended the Williams family's four-year hold on the trophy. Venus Williams won in 2000 and 2001, while Serena beat her older sister in the final the next two years.
""I don't know what happened,"" Williams said. ""I didn't play great and I didn't win.""
Sharapova showed right from the outset that she wasn't intimidated by Williams. She moved her from side to side. She stepped in on short balls and knocked off winners. She mixed searing groundstrokes with topspin lobs. She pumped her fists.
""She's kind of like me,"" Williams said. ""She doesn't back off, she keeps giving it her all.""
From 1-1, Sharapova won five straight games to win the opening set in 30 minutes. Williams went up a break at 4-2 in the second, but Sharapova broke right back and won the last four games.
Sharapova was born in Siberia and moved at a young age to the Black Sea resort of Sochi. When she was 5, she was spotted by Martina Navratilova at a clinic in Moscow. She moved to Florida at 7 and joined Nick Bollettieri's tennis academy at 9.
The 6-foot blonde has a modeling contract, drawing comparisons to Anna Kournikova. But, unlike Kournikova, she can win tournaments. Sharapova had three tour titles coming into Wimbledon.
Robert Landsdorp, who has coached Sharapova in California, said he never expected her to win Wimbledon so soon.
""I don't remember when I saw somebody so young come in and play like that in their first final,"" he said.","The context explicitly states that Maria Sharapova defeated Serena Williams in the Women's Singles final with a score of 6–1, 6–4, making her the first Russian to win a Wimbledon singles title and the third-youngest women's champion in history.",45,1,1,1,1,1,0,21011,1440,37.24904489517212,1112361947.1679688

Very good AND fairly easy. I used a little less (raw) sugar. Reading through the comments was helpful...great tips...especially about how much to whip the cream. We've had a hard time finding a restaurant that does it right. I got it the first time with this recipe and the tips from others. It looks like it should look like a Guiness with a good head of foam.

i've made this recipe probably a dozen times and i have to say, the biggest variant is the coffee beans used, the method and of course just make sure you have brown sugar.  Honestly i haven't played around with the type of whiskey so much, but from what i gather it could be another variable to making the perfect irish coffee.  Like others have said make sure the cream is only slightly whipped, too much and it just sits as a blob atop the drink, preventing any liquid from passing through it. You know you have whipped it right, if over time it slowly starts incorporating with the drink. Jay O'Connor 2014-02-08T18:30:07Z item not reviewed by moderator and published
I filled up a 1 oz shot glass to the brim with Jamesons (luckily, i had just purchased some heavy cream) and it was delicious.  I had two cups Christmas morning.  Oh, and I added, just the slightest drop of Peppermint extract. anne424 2013-12-26T03:20:50Z item not reviewed by moderator and published
This is the real deal as served at (with slight variations which I will mention) Tom Bergin's in Los Angels and the Golden Gate in San Francisco, two of the several places which claim to have originated the drink.    The key, as explained to me by an old bartender at Tom Bergin's many years ago is slightly -- not fully -- whipped cream.  Whip it until it just begins to thicken, that's all.  Fully whipped cream is not correct and really changes the drink for the worse.  Whipped cream from a can is -- well, any port in a storm I guess, if that's all you have.    Tom Bergin's made the drink with two teaspoons of white sugar.  A tablespoon is really excessive -- both two teaspoons and one tablespoon (as specified here) create a tooth-rattlingly sweet drink.  My preference is for a level teaspoon, but you should sweeten to taste.  White/brown/turbinado, any sugar will do and doesn't make too much difference to the drink.  The important thing is to start with good coffee! Jenni Mitten 2013-11-19T05:05:24Z item not reviewed by moderator and published

St George - Patron Saint of England
Navigation
By  Ben Johnson   |   Comments
Every nation has its own ‘Patron Saint’ who in times of great peril is called upon to help save the country from its enemies. St David is the patron saint of Wales, St Andrew of Scotland and St Patrick of Ireland - St George being the patron saint of England.
But who was St. George, and what did he do to become England’s Patron Saint?
Very little is known about St. George’s life, but it is thought he was a high ranking officer in the Roman army who was killed in around AD 303.
It seems that the Emperor Diocletian had St. George tortured to make him deny his faith in Christ. However despite some of the most terrible torture even for that time, St George showed incredible courage and faith and was finally beheaded near Lydda in Palestine. His head was later taken to Rome where it was interred in the church dedicated to him.
Stories of his strength and courage soon spread throughout Europe. The best-known story about St. George is his fight with a dragon, but it is highly unlikely that he ever fought a dragon, and even more unlikely that he ever visited England, however his name was known there as early as the eighth-century.
In the Middle Ages the dragon was commonly used to represent the Devil. Unfortunately the many legends connected with St. George’s name are fictitious, and the slaying of the ‘Dragon’ was first credited to him in the 12th century.
St. George, so the story goes, killed a dragon on the flat topped Dragon Hill in Uffington, Berkshire, and it is said that no grass grows where the dragon’s blood trickled down!
It was probably the 12th century Crusaders however who first invoked his name as an aid in battle.
King Edward III made him the Patron Saint of England when he formed the Order of the Garter in St. George's name in 1350, and the cult of the Saint was further advanced by King Henry V , at the battle of Agincourt in northern France.
Shakespeare made sure that nobody would forget St. George, and has King Henry V finishing his pre-battle speech with the famous phrase, ‘Cry God for Harry, England and St. George!’
King Henry himself, who was both warlike and devout, was thought by his followers to possess many of the saint’s characteristics.
The Tomb of St George, Lod, Israel
In England St. George’s Day is celebrated, and his flag flown, on his feast day, April 23rd.
An interesting piece of trivia - Shakespeare was born on St. George’s Day 1564, and if the story is to be believed, died on St. George’s Day 1616.
An appropriate end perhaps for the man who helped to immortalise the Saint in English tradition.

Take the Saints Trivia Quiz now!
It is uncertain when Saint George was born and historians continue to debate to this day. However, his death date is estimated to be April 23 303 A.D.
The first piece of evidence of George's existance appeared within the works of the Bollandists Daniel Papebroch, Jean Bolland, and Godfrey Henschen's Bibliotheca Hagiographica Graeca. George was one of several names listed in the historical text, and Pope Gelasius claimed George was one of the saints ""whose names are justly reverenced among men, but whose actions are known only to God.""
George was born to a Gerontios and Polychronia, a Roman officer and a Greek native of Lydda. Both were Christians from noble families of the Anici and George, Georgios in the original Greek, was raised to follow their faith.
When George was old enough, he was welcomed into Diocletian's army. by his late 20's, George became a Tribunus and served as an imperial guard for the Emperor at Nicomedia.
On February 24, 303 A.D., Diocletian, who hated Christians, announced that every Christian the army passed would be arrested and every other soldier should offer a sacrifice to the Roman gods.
George refused to abide by the order and told Diocletian, who was angry but greatly valued his friendship with George's father.
When George announced his beliefs before his peers, Diocletian was unable to keep the news to himself.
In an effort to save George, Diocletian attempted to convert him to believe in the Roman gods, offered him land, money and slaves in exchange for offering a sacrifice to the Roman gods, and made several other offers that George refused.

How many kings are in a deck of cards?
A:
Quick Answer
There are four kings in a standard deck of playing cards. One king belongs to each of the four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades.
Full Answer
The king is the highest ranking of the three face card types. After the king comes the queen and then the jack. In most games, the ace is the highest ranking card and the only card ranked above a king. A standard deck of cards contains 52 total cards that are divided evenly among the four suits. In addition to the face cards and the aces, there are cards in each suit for the numbers two through ten.

Playing Card Frequencies
A standard deck of 52 playing cards consists of 4 suits, with 13 kinds in each suit.  In many  card games, the kinds are ranked, and are often referred to as the ranks of the cards.  In some  games, the suits are also ranked.
Image from www.jfritz.com/cards
In the picture above, the four rows are the four suits.  The clubs are all in the first row, followed by the spades, then the hearts, and last the diamonds.  Among the 13 kinds, we find the numbers 2 through 10, and four other kinds.  The A stands for ace,  the J for jack, the Q for queen, and the K for king.  The jack, queen, and king are often referred  to as face cards.
In many card games, a player has a number of cards, and this is referred to as his hand.  In a few  card games, the order in which the cards are received will matter, but more often a player receives  all of the cards for his hand at one time.  It should be noted that when cards make up a hand,   the same card cannot appear twice.  In other words, selections of cards to create a hand are  done ""without replacement"" (that is, without returning the first card to the deck and replacing  it with a second).
Determining Frequencies of Different Events
The number of ways any particular event can happen will depend upon the number of cards that form  a hand.  Let us begin with the simplest possible hand, a single card.  (Most players would not  even consider this a hand, since it has only one card, but mathematicians always include the  extreme cases when creating their definitions.)
The number of ways to have a heart is 13, since there are 13 hearts.
The number of ways to not have a heart is 39, since there are 39 cards that are not hearts.
The number of ways to have a queen is 4, since there are 4 queens.
The number of ways to not have a queen is 48, since there are 48 cards that are not queens.
The number of ways to have a face card is 12, since there are 3 kinds that are face cards,  in four suits each.
When a hand consists of multiple cards, the events are much more interesting.  Suppose a hand  consists of three cards.  There are   ${}_{52} C_3 = 22100$ ways to choose such a hand.
Let us consider a single suit, say hearts.
The number of ways to have three hearts is   ${}_{13} C_3 = 286$,   since any three  hearts can be chosen from the 13 available hearts to make up the hand.
The number of ways to have two hearts and one other card that is not a heart is   $({}_{13} C_2)({}_{39} C_1) = 78 \times 39 = 3328$.   In this computation, we chose 2 of the 13  available hearts, and one of the other 39 cards to make up the hand.
The number of ways to have one heart and two other cards is   $({}_{13} C_1)({}_{39} C_2) = 13 \times 741 = 9633$.   We chose 1 of the 13 hearts, and two of  the other 39 cards to make up the hand.
The number of ways to have no hearts at all is   ${}_{39} C_3 = 9139$,   where we have chosen all 3 cards from the 39 that are not hearts.
It can be verified that the four results above in fact add to 22100, the total number of ways that  something can happen.  The fact that we used hearts as the suit was irrelevant, the same frequencies  would occur if the suit had been spades (or diamonds, or clubs).
We can do variations on that theme as well.
The number of ways to have two hearts and one diamond is   $({}_{13} C_2)({}_{13} C_1) = 78 \times 13 = 1014$.   Here, we chose 2 of the 13 hearts, and  one of the 13 diamonds.
The number of ways to have at least two hearts is   $({}_{13} C_2)({}_{39} C_1) + {}_{13} C_3 = 78 \times 39 + 286 = 3328$.   To do this problem,  we had to break ""at least two"" into the cases ""exactly two"" and ""exactly three"".

The little yellow birds that Tweety Pie is based on are called Canarys because they come from the Canary Islands , not the other way around. The archipelago actually gets its name from dogs. The Romans, upon first discovering the islands called them the Isle of Dogs, so their modern name is derived from the old Latin Insula Canaria, after the large number of both wild and domesticated dogs they found there. Dogs have been important in the Canary Islands in all known history, going right back to the ancient, Guanche, inhabitants. Archaeological excavations in several burial caves in Tenerife have shown that the dog was buried with his master, so it could ""guide the soul to the region of the dead"".

Travel guide - Prague
In Prague, a magical atmosphere reigns. In the capital of the Czech Republic, the skies are populated with thousands of steeples and the houses are locked in an eternal dance. For over a millennium, this city has exuded a delicate architectural alchemy and has built up a cultural mosaic from all over Europe.
Caressed by the waters of the Vltava, the city is lulled by a soundtrack of classical music, as you will find out during your stay in Prague. From     the old city and its maze of narrow streets to Prague Castle, the emblem of the city, Prague is a cultural symphony that can hold its head up high among     the other European capitals.
Sample the bohemian magic and explore the romantic side of Prague. From the Old Town Square you can admire the polychrome facades of the townhouses. On     your trip to Prague, take a few minutes to admire the mechanism of the astronomical clock. The St. Vitus Cathedral, the construction of which began     in 1344 and was completed in 1929 is another famous symbol of this city where time seems to have stopped.
The Charles Bridge, which has witnessed much of the history of Prague, connects the old town district with the Malá Stana (Little Quarter), a small     middle-class neighbourhood with a profusion of Baroque-influenced palaces and churches.
On your trip to Prague, take a step back in time and stroll through the oldest part of the city: the Jewish Quarter. Visit the Jewish Museum and the     Jewish cemetery, the resting place of some of the most illustrious characters in history, and you will discover the roots of Prague's Jewish culture.
A trip to Prague can sometimes feel Kafkaesque. All types of architecture - all genres - come together. Art Nouveau, Cubism and Renaissance form an     unlikely family. You can explore the delicate lines of the Municipal House, the Surrealist curves of the Caza Danzante or the Cubist forms of the House of     the Black Madonna.
This cultural diversity is not limited to architecture. Prague is a city of great taste. The city’s cafés and breweries are an invitation to sample the     famous Czech beers. And if the mood takes you, you can explore Prague’s nightlife in the up and coming suburbs of Vinohrady and Zizkov, a playground for     the city’s youth and avant-garde.
Romantic, mysterious or magical, whatever elements attract you, Prague is an enchanting city.

qz_1429,What is the final event in a decathlon?,1500 metres,"The decathlon is a combined event in ... One hour decathlon is a special type of decathlon, in which the athletes have to start the last of ten events ... The decathlon is a combined event in athletics consisting of ten track and field events. Events are held over two consecutive days and the winners are determined by the combined performance in all. Performance is judged on a points system in each event, not by the position achieved. The decathlon is contested mainly by male athletes, while female athletes typically compete in the heptathlon. Traditionally, the title of ""World's Greatest Athlete"" has been given to the man who wins the decathlon. This began when King Gustav V of Sweden told Jim Thorpe, ""You, sir, are the world's greatest athlete"" after Thorpe won the decathlon at the Stockholm Olympics in 1912. The current holder of the title is American Bryan Clay, the gold medal winner of the event at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, who took the title from Athens Olympics Czech champion Roman Šebrle. The event developed from the ancient pentathlon. Pentathlon competitions were held at the ancient Greek Olympics. Pentathlons involved five disciplines – long jump, discus throw, javelin throw, sprint and a wrestling match. Introduced in Olympia during 708 BC, the competition was extremely popular for many centuries. By the 6th century BC, pentathlons had become part of religious games. The Amateur Athletic Union held ""all around events"" from the 1880s and a decathlon first appeared on the Olympic athletics program at the 1904 Games. Format Men’s decathlon The vast majority of international and top level men’s decathlons are divided into a two-day competition, with the track and field events held in the order below. Traditionally, all decathletes who finished the event do a round of honour together after the competition, rather than just the winner or medalling athletes. Day 1 1500 metres Women’s decathlon At major championships, the women’s equivalent of the decathlon is the seven-event heptathlon; prior to 1981 it was the five-event pentathlon. However, in 2001 the IAAF approved scoring tables for women’s decathlon; the current world record holder is Austra Skujyt? of Lithuania. Women’s disciplines differ from men’s in the same way as for standalone events: the shot, discus and javelin weigh less, and the sprint hurdles uses lower hurdles over 100 m rather than 110 m. The points tables used are the same as for the heptathlon in the shared events. The schedule of events differs from the men’s decathlon, with the field events switched between day one and day two; this is to avoid scheduling conflicts when men’s and women’s decathlon competitions take place simultaneously. Day 1","The context mentions that the decathlon consists of ten track and field events held over two consecutive days.

About This Statistic
This statistic shows the ten biggest cities in Turkey in 2013. At the end of 2013, approximately 13.8 million people lived in Istanbul, making it the biggest city in Turkey.
The urban population of Turkey
The total population of Turkey is on its way to reaching 80 million inhabitants, which is about the same amouint as the population of Germany . Slightly more than half of the Turkish population live in urban areas , with Istanbul being home to the largest portion of this urban population with close to 14 million inhabitants. This is about 20 percent of the entire population.
Istanbul is located at the entrance to the Black Sea, between Europe and Asia. It is attractive to both the  people of Turkey as a place to live and work and foreign tourists who take advantage of its cultural and historic center. Due to its attractiveness and its location at the crossroads of the east and the west, the city has been investing in transportation infrastructure to support its strategic location and increasing growth.
Ankara, the capital of Turkey, is the second largest city and home to about 4.5 million people. Izmir is the third largest, with almost 3 million inhabitants. A vast amount of the country’s population is located in these three metropolises.
Economic growth in Turkey has decreased significantly since 2011 and increasing unemployment is a matter of concern, which may cause an increase in urban population due to people moving away from the rural areas in search of work. While joining the European Union has been a goal of Turkey for quite some time, tensions between Turkey and other nations are on the rise, as restrictions of freedom of expression and censorship by the government are also increasing.

Istanbul  Population 2016
Istanbul is the largest city in Turkey and the heart of the country. It is also one of the largest agglomerations in Europe and the fifth largest city in the world in terms of population within city limits. Interestingly, Istanbul is a transcontinental city as it is located on the Bosphorus waterway in northwest Turkey between the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara. This means the commercial center is in Europe while the rest of the city is in Asia. In 2016, Istanbul has an estimated population of over 14.6 million.
Istanbul has grown very rapidly over the past one hundred years, although it has always had a large population. Istanbul has remained one of the largest cities in the world for most of its long history. In fact, Istanbul (then Constantinople) had a population between 400,000 and 500,000 in 500 AD, pushing out Rome as the largest ever city in the world at the time.
Istanbul has a very large area, which makes it one of the five most populous world cities, but its metropolitan area does not even rank in the top fifteen, as the metro area is nearly equivalent to the city proper.
Istanbul has a population density of 2,523 people per square kilometer (6,530/sq mi), far greater than Turkey's density of 102 people per square kilometer. The most densely populated areas are the southwest, west and northwest of the city center as well as the European side, while the most densely populated district is the Asian side, Uskudar.
Istanbul Demographics
Istanbul has a very small foreign population of just 43,000 in 2007, but only 28% of the population originates from Istanbul. Istanbul is home to most of the ethnic and religious minorities in Turkey.
The Kurdish community is the largest ethnic minority in the city, originating from southeastern and eastern Turkey, with a population of up to 3 million in Istanbul. This is the largest Kurdish population in the world.

LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM – Welcome to Eurovision: You Decide, the national selection of the United Kingdom which takes place at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town, London hosted by television presenter, actress and comedienne Mel Giedroyc. Six acts are participating and the audience will have 100% say in the final decision. Expert panel will be made of: Carrie Grant: Vocal coach and television presenter. She was a member of the group Sweet Dream that represented the United Kingdom in the 1983 contest with the song I’m Never Giving Up. She has also been a member of the UK jury at the Eurovision Song Contest. Katrina Leskanich: Lead singer of the group Katrina & The Waves that won the 1997 Eurovision Song Contest for the United Kingdom with the song Love Shine A Light. Jay Revell: Stage director, actor and dancer. He was the choreographer behind the music video and stage performance of the 2015 United Kingdom entry Still In Love With You. Guest performers in tonight’s show will be: Måns Zelmerlöw: Winner of the 2015 Eurovision Song Contest for Sweden with the song Heroes and Katrina Leskanich: Winner of the 1997 Eurovision Song Contest for the United Kingdom with the song Love Shine A Light.
WATCH THE SHOW LIVE AT 20:30 CET
The show began with a video wondering how the UK will come back to the scoreboard after bad results and its first national final in years. The hostess is a brilliant presenter and gives a stunning British presentation to the show introducing the six participants, praising Katrina who is the actual last UK winner in Eurovision, informed the audience how to register online for the web voting and introduced the 2015 Eurovision winner on stage, Måns, who performed live his Eurovision entry “Heroes” followed by his amazing backdrops we all saw in Vienna.
When You Go sung by Dulcima (Composed by Tomas Twyman)  (Listen here) : Dulcima Showan aged 23 met songwriter Tomas Twyman aged 27 when they were both busking together on the streets of Canterbury. Dulcima is a classical violinist who loves to play folk. They will both be performing the original song penned by Tom. Their performance was definitely not what we would have expected. The female singer is nervous and the vocals are not sounding good. There is definitely not a match between the two singers and the happy country feeling is definitely not spread on television. Definitely not a good start for the show and definitely not a winner tonight. The panel is not exactly enthusiastic especially Carrie, while Jay finds them electric enough for Stockholm, Katrina tries to be neutral on this one.
A Better Man sung by Matthew James (Composed by Helienne Lindvall, Andrew Fromm and Peter Kvint)  (Listen here) : Matthew James has previously had a brush with fame as part of nineties boyband Bad Boys Inc, and their hit single ‘More To This World’. Matthew now 44 lives in South London and has continued singing for the last 15 years with the band Madhen. In the performance now: somehow the music is lower than the voice and I cannot get excited enough with this entry although the studio version is quid magical. Matthew is given a convincing vocal performance and his song is definitely an old time classic song which can really convince Eurovision audience as well. Descent performance and adequate presentation. Jay says the signer made a connection with the audience, Carrie emphasises on the confidence of the singer and Katrina says the song has a good narrative and inspiring lyrics.

The Quick 10: 10 Gestation Periods in the Animal Kingdom | Mental Floss The Quick 10: 10 Gestation Periods in the Animal Kingdom Image credit: Like us on Facebook So, I'm pretty much done being pregnant. I mean, I'm not “ I'm only 30 weeks “ but mentally, I'm over this. But I really shouldn't be complaining “ 40 weeks is nothing compared to some of the animal kingdom. Of course, it's also a really long time compared to others. By the way, when a pregnant woman tells you she's tired or achy or {insert crappy ailment here}, don't respond with ""Be glad you're not an elephant; they gestate for 22 months!"" because you will probably get punched. Just sayin'. 1. Elephants - anywhere from 600-660 days is normal. If you're thinking ""You know, I've never seen an elephant give birth,"" I can help you out . You know that scene in The Shining where the blood gushes out of the elevator? Yeah, it's kind of like that. But the part after that is pretty cool. 2. Hippos - eight months. Yes, it takes less time to make a hippopotamus than it takes to make a human. COME ON! 3. Giraffe - 14-15 months. A baby giraffe made the news in December when she was born at the Calgary Zoo in Canada. She was on the small side for a baby giraffe, coming in at a mere 5'10"" and 130 pounds. Another fascinating tidbit: giraffes give birth standing up, so it's pretty normal for a baby to fall six feet to the ground. 4. Killer Whale ““ 17 months. But there's a good reason for that ““ after that 17 months, Baby Shamu emerges weighing anywhere from 265-353 pounds and measuring about 8.5 feet long. Yikes. 5. Opossum - 12-13 days, which is one of the shortest gestation periods we know of in a mammal. But since the lifespan of an opossum is only two to four years, this makes sense. 6. Gerbils ““ 23-26 days. 7. Gorillas ““ 8.5 months. It's not a huge surprise that their gestational periods are pretty similar to ours, right? 8. Grizzly/Black Bears ““ 220 days. Also less than a human. Not. Fair. 9. Porcupine ““ 112 days, which is the longest gestation period of any rodent. And surely the most painful. I kid ““ porcupine babies (AKA porcupettes) are actually born with soft quills ““ it's not until after birth that they harden up. Picture from ZooBabies.com . By the way, if you're a fan of CuteOverload, you should definitely check out ZooBorns. They have baby animal pictures of everything from aardvark to zebra. It's pretty fascinating. There's even a baby beluga. 10. Walrus ““ 15 months. Baby walruses? Not so cute . And congrats to our own Will Pearson, whose baby recently completed gestation. We've got a new generation of _flossers coming up! More from mental_floss... What Animal Has the Longest Pregnancy? What Animal Has the Longest Pregnancy? By Remy Melina | March 2, 2011 04:47pm ET MORE Credit: Los Angeles Zoo Elephants have the longest gestation period of all mammals. These gentle giants' pregnancies last for more than a year and a half. The average gestation period of an elephant is about 640 to 660 days, or roughly 95 weeks. By comparison, a human pregnancy lasts an average of 280 days, or 40 weeks. Female elephants live for 60 to 70 years, but only have about four offspring throughout their lifetime. Although elephants usually only carry one baby at a time, one to two percent of elephant births produce twins. When an elephant gives birth, the other elephants in the herd form a protective circle around the mother during the delivery . Which animal has the longest gestation period? | Reference.com Which animal has the longest gestation period? A: Quick Answer The eel-like frilled shark has the longest gestation period in the animal kingdom. This shark dwells in deep waters off the coasts of South Africa and Chile, and Science Focus suggests that the intense cold of its habitat may contribute to its long, slow gestation. Full Answer The elephant holds the record for the longest gestation period of any mammal at 22 months. This exceeds even the gestation period of whales, which ranges from 10 to 18 months, depending on the species. The record for the shortest gestation of any mammal belongs to the Virginia opossum, which gives birth after a mere 12 days, after which the offspring spends several months living in the mother's pouch. search_results.search_context[3]: Which animal has the longest pregnancy? | Science Focus Which animal has the longest pregnancy? 22nd July 2009 New Year Offer! 50% off when you subscribe to BBC Focus Magazine today* Asked by: Kerry Bradshaw, Market Weighton The 22-month gestation period of the African elephant is the longest among the land mammals. But this is far surpassed by the eel-like frilled shark (Chlamydoselachus anguineus) found off the coasts of South Africa and Chile, which Japanese scientists have shown to have a gestation period that may be as long as 42 months. This could be due to the intense cold of its deep-sea habitat slowing its metabolic processes to a crawl. Other deep-dwelling animals may have similarly extended gestation periods. Read more Q&As search_results.search_context[4]: What Animals Stay Pregnant for a Long Time? | Animals - mom.me What Animals Stay Pregnant for a Long Time? An elephant will never forget her two-year pregnancy. Anup Shah/Digital Vision/Getty Images Nine months can feel like an eternity to a pregnant woman, but 266 days is short compared to the longer gestation periods that many animals go through. For most species, the gestation period typically runs from conception until birth. The length of the gestation period for many animals is determined by the size of their species. Smaller species of animals generally have a shorter gestation period than bigger animals. In some instances, longer gestation periods can be found among more developed species. The Longest Wait Elephants are social animals with a high degree of intelligence similar to dolphins and great apes. These gentle giants have the longest gestation period of all mammals, carrying their developing babies for nearly two years before giving birth. Because elephants are the largest land animal in the world with the biggest brains, their long gestation period allows for proper development of the fetus in the womb. After the gestation period, a single elephant calf is born that weights about 265 pounds. While female elephants can live up to 70 years, they generally only give birth to four babies during their lifetime. 16 Months of Patience The white rhino is one of the largest of all rhino species, so it's not surprising that her large stature would lead to a long gestation period of 15 to 16 months. After the gestation period, the mother gives birth to a single calf weighing around 143 pounds. Female rhinos typically give birth to one calf at intervals of every two to three years. A calf will remain with her mother for around two to four years until the next offspring is born. All five species of rhinoceros are considered either critically endangered or vulnerable to being endangered, including the white rhino. Their long and slow gestation period is an obstacle to repopulating the species. The 14-Month Hump Native to areas of the Middle East, northern India and arid Africa, the camel has evolved to survive in the desert and can go without water for up to three weeks. They are often referred to as “ships of the desert"" because these sturdy creatures have served to transport humans and cargo across long distances throughout history. Camels are considered to be ill-tempered with stubborn personalities, even biting, spitting and kicking humans. Their long gestation periods of 13 to 14 months might contribute to their grumpiness. After the gestation period, they give birth to a single calf. Finally Falling Out With a gestation period of 15 to 16 months, the giraffe has one of the longest gestation periods in the animal kingdom. Known for being the tallest terrestrial animal in the world, the mother gives birth while standing up. The baby calf emerges with her front legs and head first and then falls to the ground, which serves to sever the umbilical cord. The newborn giraffe will already stand 6 feet tall and be able to walk and run within only one hour after birth. Calves remain dependent on their mother’s milk for nine to 12 months. 400-Pound Baby Orcas, also known as killer whales, are typically found in the Antarctic and Arctic, and occasionally off the coast of Oregon, Washington and California. Known for their high intelligence, gestation is typically between13 to 16 months. After gestation, a single calf is born that weighs around 400 pounds and can measure up to 7 feet long. A calf will remain by his mother's side for up to two years. Orca whales have become one of the most contaminated marine animals in the world. Chemical and pollution contamination of the oceans has led orcas to be more susceptible to disease, which most likely causes reproductive difficulties, according to Defenders of Wildlife.",The context explicitly mentions that the African elephant has a 22-month gestation period and is noted as the longest among land mammals. This directly answers the question about the animal with a gestation period around 22 months.,28,1,1,1,1,1,0,7918,2423,56.023066997528076,1112361947.1679688

Please add a ""relative"" entry to your dictionary.
Beavers are famously busy, and they turn their talents to reengineering the landscape as few other animals can. When sites are available, beavers burrow in the banks of rivers and lakes. But they also transform less suitable habitats by building dams. Felling and gnawing trees with their strong teeth and powerful jaws, they create massive log, branch, and mud structures to block streams and turn fields and forests into the large ponds that beavers love.
Domelike beaver homes, called lodges, are also constructed of branches and mud. They are often strategically located in the middle of ponds and can only be reached by underwater entrances. These dwellings are home to extended families of monogamous parents, young kits, and the yearlings born the previous spring.","The context explicitly mentions that beaver homes are called ""lodges,"" which are constructed of branches and mud and are strategically located in the middle of ponds with underwater entrances.",30,1,1,1,1,1,0,14310,337,10.834966897964478,1112361947.1679688

Marsupials are mammals that give birth to underdeveloped embryos, which then climb from the birth canal into a pouch on the front of the mother's body. Once inside, the infant, sometimes called a joey, feeds and continues to grow by attaching itself to a nipple. While most marsupials are native to Australia and the surrounding islands, some are found in the Americas.
Kangaroos and Wallabies
Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea are home to more than 50 species of kangaroos and wallabies, known as macropods, due to the large feet of these marsupials. The largest, the red kangaroo of Australia's inland plains, can be up to six feet tall; gray kangaroos are smaller and found in woodlands. Wallabies, medium-sized marsupials, live in a variety of habitats, including shrubs, swamps and rocky cliffs. Ground-dwelling kangaroos and wallabies get around by hopping. There are also 14 species of arboreal kangaroos, two of which, the Bennett and Lumholtz varieties, occur in Australia. Kangaroos and wallabies are herbivores that eat a variety of grasses and other vegetation.
Koalas
The gray-furred, tree-dwellers commonly referred to as koala bears are also marsupials. A koala's pouch faces backward, an adaptation that enabled its burrower ancestors to dig tunnels without getting dirt in their pouches. Found in eastern and southeastern Australia, koalas live in eucalyptus trees, the leaves of which comprise their entire diet. Koalas grow to be two to three feet long and weigh between nine and 29 pounds.
Wombats
The wombat, which the National Geographic website describes as ""pudgy,"" is a burrower marsupial with brown or gray fur. Like a koala, a wombat's pouch faces the legs to keep dirt out as the animal digs. Wombats are herbivores that feed on grasses, roots, tubers and even tree bark. There are three species: the common wombat, northern hairy-nosed wombat and southern hairy-nosed wombat. Hairy-nosed wombats have larger ears and softer fur than common wombats.
Tasmanian Devils
Named by European settlers for the fierce temper they display when threatened or fighting for food, today the nocturnal Tasmanian devil occurs only on the island of Tasmania. It has black or dark brown fur, grows up to 30 inches in length and can weigh up to 26 pounds. Females give birth to 20 to 30 young at a time, but only have enough nipples inside their pouches to nourish four. Tasmanian devils, the largest carnivorous marsupial, consume fish, insects, snakes, birds and carrion.

Edit Storyline In the middle of a raging thunderstorm, a traveling circus accidentally leaves behind some very precious cargo--a baby zebra. The gangly little foal is rescued by horse farmer Nolan Walsh, who takes him home to his young daughter Channing. Once a champion thoroughbred trainer, Walsh has given up horse training for a quiet life with Channing on their modest Kentucky farm. The little zebra, or ""Stripes,"" as Channing calls him, is soon introduced to the farm's misfit troupe of barnyard residents, led by a cranky Shetland Pony named Tucker and Franny, a wise old goat who keeps the family in line. The group is joined by Goose, a deranged big-city pelican who's hiding out in the sticks until the heat dies down in Jersey. The un-aptly named bloodhound Lightening keeps a lazy eye on goings-on at the farm - in between naps.

qz_1745,Author Dick Francis is famous for writing novels based around which sport?,Horseracing,"Context: Dick Francis was a famous British steeple chase jockey and crime writer, whose novels centre on horse racing in England. All his novels deal with crime in the horse-racing world, some of the criminals being outwardly respectable figures. The stories are narrated by one of the key players, often a jockey, but sometimes a trainer, an owner, a bookie, or someone in a different profession, peripherally linked to racing. This person is always facing great obstacles, often including physical injury, from which he must fight back with determination. More than forty of these novels became international best-sellers.","The context explicitly mentions that Dick Francis's novels centre on horse racing in England and deal with crime in the horse-racing world, confirming that his novels are based around horseracing.",26,1,1,1,1,1,0,14015,271,9.87113618850708,1112361947.1679688
qz_1794,Which Scottish newspaper features the Broons and Oor Wullie?,The Sunday Post,"The first Oor Wullie cartoon ran on 8 March 1936, in the newly launched ""Fun Section"" of another Scottish newspaper, the Sunday Post, at a time when comics were thought solely the preserve of children who had yet to tune in to the telly. The brainchild of Robert Low, the paper's managing editor, Oor Wullie ran alongside a another new cartoon featuring a family with which it would become synonymous: The Broons, of No 10 Glebe Street, Glasgow. Wullie, drawn in his famous black dungarees and hardy, or ""muckle"", boots by artist Dudley D Watkins, caught the imagination of young and old with his particular brand of mischief. Showing ingenuity all too common to pre-adolescent Scots wandering the streets, Wullie would routinely antagonise his Ma and Pa, fight his bullying enemy, Basher McTurk, and evade his neighbourhood policeman, PC Murdoch, ever returning to sit on his trusty, rusty bucket. Occasionally, a member of the Broon clan would appear in the story. Though the first cartoon shows a mischievous Wullie rerouting tram lines so a carriage crashes into a steamroller, the humour was usually a mix of subtle patter and belly-shuddering moments of situation comedy. Wullie's comedic misadventures helped the newspaper to reach an astonishing 79 per cent of the adult population of Scotland by 1971, registering more than three million readers on Watkins' retirement that year.","The context explicitly mentions that both Oor Wullie and The Broons first appeared in the ""Fun Section"" of The Sunday Post, a Scottish newspaper, on 8 March 1936. It also states that Oor Wullie is published in The Sunday Post, confirming that this newspaper features both comic strips.",38,1,1,1,1,1,0,10385,478,14.21724247932434,1112361947.1679688

Bob Cratchit (Character)
Mickey's Christmas Carol (1983)
Cratchit :   Tomorrow is Christmas and I was wondering if I could have... Half a day off?
Scrooge :   Christmas, eh? Uh, er... I suppose so. But I'll dock you half a day's pay. Let's see, I pay you two shillings a day...
Cratchit :   Two shillings and a halfpenny, Sir.
Scrooge :   Oh yes, I gave you that raise three years ago.
Cratchit :   Yes, sir, when I started doing your laundry.
Fred :   Merry Christmas, Uncle Scrooge!
Scrooge :   What's so merry about it? I'll tell you what Christmas is. It's just another work day, and any jackanape who thinks else should be boiled in his own pudding!
Cratchit :   But sir, Christmas is a time for giving... a time to be with one's family.
Scrooge :   I say, Bah humbug!
Fred :   I don't care! I say, Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas!
Cratchit :  [clapping] Well said, Master Fred!
Scrooge :   Cratchit, what are you doing?
Cratchit :  [stops clapping] I was just trying to keep my hands warm, sir.
[Bob closes his book and starts to leave as the clock chimes 7:00. Scrooge looks at his watch]
Scrooge :   Hmm... Two minutes fast.
[Bob stops then goes back to his desk]
Scrooge :   Well, never mind those two minutes. You may go now.
Cratchit :   Ah, oh thank you, sir! You're so kind!
Scrooge :   Never mind that mushy stuff, just go! But be here all the other early the next day!
Cratchit :   I will, I will, sir! And a Bah Humbug... I mean, a Merry Christmas to you, sir!
Cratchit :   Oh, that Fred. Always so full of kindness.
Scrooge :   Aye. He always was a little peculiar
[door bell rings]
Cratchit :   Why, Mr. Scrooge, Merry Christmas.
[Scrooge barges in]
Cratchit :   Won't you come in?
Scrooge :   Merry Christmas? Humph! I have another bundle for you.
Cratchit :   But sir, it's Christmas Day.
Scrooge :   Christmas Day, indeed! Just another excuse for being lazy. And another thing, Cratchit: I've had enough of this 'half-day off' stuff! You leave me no alternative...
[changing his attitude]
Scrooge :   ...but to give you...
Tiny Tim :  [sees the contents of the now open bag] Toys!
Scrooge :   Yes, toys. No no no no no no no!
[lovingly]
Scrooge :   I'm giving you a raise... and making you my partner.
Cratchit :   Ha-ha. That Fred, always so full of kindness.
Scrooge :   Aye, he always was a little peculiar

Bob Cratchit :   Well, my loves, which one do you like best, eh?
Kathy Cratchit :   I like the dolly in the corner.
Tiny Tim :   I like all of them.
Bob Cratchit :   Good boy? And why not one in particular?
Tiny Tim :   Well... you said I can't have none of them, so I might as well like them all.
Ebenezer Scrooge :   And be good enough to leave me alone during business hours.
Nephew Fred :   Seven o'clock on Christmas Eve? That's not business hours, that's drudgery for the sake of it, and an insult to all men of goodwill.
Nephew Fred :  [surprised] Thank you, Bob Cratchit.
[Scrooge slowly turns on Cratchit]
Ebenezer Scrooge :   Another word from you, Cratchit, and you will celebrate Christmas by losing your position.
[He then slowly turns back on Fred]
Ebenezer Scrooge :   As for you, nephew, if you were in my will, I'd disinherit you!
Ebenezer Scrooge :  [to Bob] You still don't recognise me, do you Cratchit?
Bob Cratchit :   Yes. No. Er... Father Christmas?
[pulls down his mask briefly]
Mrs. Cratchit :   Mr. Scrooge? He's gone mad!
Bob Cratchit :   No, no, my dear, I'm sure there's an explanation.
Ebenezer Scrooge :   I want to see you in my office on Monday morning, when I will double your wages.
Ebeneezer Scrooge :   Cratchit, bring me the Curiosity Shop account. I saw a light and enquired at the oyster shop. They came back last night, though the old man's granddaughter is sick. Come on, come on.

Record-Breakers and Trivia -  everyHit.com
Back To The 'Records & Trivia' Index
Most Number 1s
This, possibly the most important record, is held by Elvis Presley. He has had 21 chart-toppers, 18 of them different songs (three titles have topped the chart on two distinctly separate chart runs as part of the series of re-issues to commemorate what would have been Elvis' 70th birthday in 2005).  You can see how this record has 'changed hands' over the years here .
The Beatles are the top group with 17 number 1s.  Madonna is the top woman with 13 (as of April 2008).  Top female group is The Spice Girls with 9.
Only seven acts in chart history have got into double figures with their tally of chart-toppers. They are:  Elvis Presley (21, 18 different songs), The Beatles (17), Cliff Richard (14 : six of them with The Shadows, one with The Drifters, one with The Young Ones), Westlife (14 : one of them with Mariah Carey), Madonna (13), The Shadows (11 : six of them with Cliff Richard, two of these also with The Norrie Paramor Strings) and Take That (11: one featuring Lulu).
Westlife hold the record for getting into double-figures in the shortest time (2 years and 10 months [ie. 149 weeks] - more than 3 months quicker than The Beatles (who took 165 weeks). Unlike Westlife, however,  The Beatles tended to spend several weeks at the summit, slowing down their release rate.)
It is worth pointing out that Paul McCartney has appeared on more Number 1s than any other artist under a diverse range of credits. He has, in fact, appeared on 24 Number 1s; solo (1), with Wings (1), Stevie Wonder, The Christians et al (1), Ferry Aid (1), Band Aid (1), Band Aid 20 (1) and The Beatles (17).
In total, twenty-one artists have appeared on ten or more number one singles. They are:
Paul McCartney (24), Elvis Presley (21), John Lennon (20), George Harrison (18), Ringo Starr (16), Cliff Richard (15), Nicky Byrne, Kian Egan, Mark Feehily, Shane Filan (14), Robbie Williams, Madonna (13), Gary Barlow, Brian McFadden (12), Mel C , Geri Halliwell (11), Mel B, Emma Bunton, Howard Donald, Jason Orange, Mark Owen (10).
Artist with Most Weeks at Number 1
It's Elvis Presley. He has topped the chart for a total of 80 weeks (as of w/e 5th Feb 2005).
Top group is The Beatles (69 weeks). Top female performer is Madonna (29 weeks - as of w/e 17th May 2008).
In his many different manifestations, however, Paul McCartney has spent 93 weeks at the top.
Most Consecutive Number 1s
7 - by The Beatles and Westlife.
The Beatles' stretch began with ""A Hard Day's Night"" in 1964 and lasted to ""Yellow Submarine""/""Eleanor Rigby"" in 1966. The run was broken when ""Penny Lane""/""Strawberry Fields Forever"" merely made the number 2 position the following year!
Westlife's stint began with their debut, ""Swear it Again"" in 1999 and ran through to ""My Love"" in November 2000 (though one hit was a 'duet' with Mariah Carey). It was broken by ""What Makes A Man"" which peaked at number 2 the following month.
Beatles fans are, however, quick to point out that ""Ain't She Sweet"" (which made number 29 in 1964) was recorded in 1961, well before their EMI contract. It was issued by Polydor to 'cash in' on the success of the fab four. Fans argue that  this was not an ""official"" Beatles release. If this logic is accepted (though the track did make the charts), The Beatles run of successive number ones begins with ""From Me To You"" in April 1963 - making a total of 11.
Top female group is The Spice Girls (6 in a row from ""Wannabe"" through to ""Too Much"").
Longest Span of Number 1 Singles
47 years, 6 months and 23 days. Held by Elvis Presley. His first number 1 was ""All Shook Up"" in 1957 (w/e 13th June). His most recent chart-topper was the re-issue of ""It's Now Or Never"" in 2005 (w/e 5th Feb).
Runner up is Cliff Richard. His first chart-topper was ""Living Doll"" in 1959. His latest was ""The Millennium Prayer"" in 1999, a span of 40, 4 months and 15 days. (+ 21 days for total span).
Longest span for a female artist with solo credit is Madonna on 20 Years, 7 Months, 1 Day (from ""Into The Groove"", 3rd Aug 1985 to ""Sorry"", 4th March 2006 - ie. a total span of 1074 weeks). [NB: if we include ""4 Minutes"" - which also credited Justin Timberlake, the span runs through to 10th May 2008 (22 years, 9 Months, 13 Days) but then  this record is broken by Cher - see below.]
Kyie Minogue is still both popular and productive and, on 15 Years, 9 Months, and 23 Days (ie. 825 weeks from ""I Should Be So Lucky"", 23rd Jan 1988 to ""Slow""; 15th Nov 2003), regularly poses a threat to Madonna in this regard.

There had been a confrontation at Christmas 1965 between the Krays and the Richardsons at the Astor Club, when Cornell, an associate of the Richardsons, referred to Ronnie Kray as a ""fat poof"". A gang war followed, and Kray associate Richard Hart was murdered at Mr Smith's Club in Catford on 8 March 1966. Ronnie Kray avenged Hart's death by shooting George Cornell in the Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel Road. ""Mad"" Frankie Fraser was taken to court for Hart's murder but was found not guilty. A member of the Richardsons gang claimed that he saw him kicking Hart. Cornell was the only one to escape from the brawl in top condition so it is likely that Ronnie thought that he was involved in the murder. Owing to intimidation, witnesses would not cooperate with the police.",The context explicitly states that Ronnie Kray shot George Cornell in the Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel Road.

qz_1872,Who composed the musical theme for the Pink Panther?,Henry Mancini,"""The Pink Panther Theme"" was written by Henry Mancini as the opening title music to the film comedy of the same name, which starred Peter Sellers as the bumbling Inspector Clouseau. The song evolved from a single cartoon cell conceived of the feline character featured in the opening credits, and Mancini only provided a tempo to the animators, rather than a complete score as was usual in the business. The accents of the brass section and the now-famous ""dead ant"" cadence had an immediate appeal to moviegoers, while jazz musician Plas Johnson was specifically recruited by Mancini for the now-legendary tenor sax solo. Mancini quickly realized that the music was also perfect for the jewel thief's character in the film (played by David Niven ), so the opening music became the recurring theme throughout the movie. Mancini 's recording is easily the most widely known, though a jazz treatment recorded by alto sax great Phil Woods with trumpeter Carl Saunders merits attention as well.","The context explicitly states that Henry Mancini composed the musical theme for the Pink Panther. It mentions that ""The Pink Panther Theme"" was written by him as the opening title music for the film, and that he composed the entirety of the film score.",34,1,1,1,1,1,0,10172,367,10.803002119064331,1112361947.1679688

The series featured three seperate seven minute cartoon segments: one featuring Huckleberry Hound ; another starring Yogi Bear and his sidekick Boo Boo; and a third with Pixie & Dixie and Mr. Jinks, two mice who in each short found a new way to outwit the cat Mr. Jinks. The Yogi Bear segment of the show proved more popular than Huckleberry's; and it spawned its own series in 1961, The Yogi Bear Show . A segment featuring Hokey Wolf and Ding-A-Ling was added, replacing Yogi Bear during the 1960–61 season. In 1961, the series became the first animated program to be honored with an Emmy Award. The Huckleberry Hound Show contributed to making Hanna-Barbera a household name, and is often credited with legitimizing the concept of animation produced specifically for television.","The context mentions that Mr. Jinks is the cat who often chases Pixie and Dixie and says ""I hate meeces to pieces!""

Category Famous Movie Robots - Illustrated History of Film Robots *batteries not included (1987) (aka Miracle on 8th Street) ""Fix-it"" Robots In this Steven Spielberg-produced film, mysterious philanthropic, flying-saucer-shaped, living 'fix-it' mechanical robots came to the aid of elderly tenants (including diner owners Frank and Faye Riley, Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy). The seniors were threatened with eviction in their soon-to-be-demolished New York apartment building. The two good-natured but shy adult fix-it robots had three babies: Wheems, Jetsom and Flotsom, and continually repaired broken items, as well as served cheeseburgers in the diner. The film was a composite of E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) and Cocoon (1985). ""Fix-It"" Robots Cherry 2000 (1987) Cherry 2000 This science-fiction futuristic film had a tagline describing the title character: ""She's Blond, Beautiful and Forever Young."" In a post-apocalyptic world in the year 2017, Sam Treadwell (David Andrews), the head of an Anaheim recycling plant, employed a perfect girlfriend -- a rare, irreplaceable, top-of-the-line blonde-haired sex robot named Cherry 2000 (Pamela Gidley). She was programmed with a shiny ""chip"" (similar to a quarter-sized mini CD) behind her ear. However, he found it difficult to replace her when she shorted out (wearing a tight red dress and yellow rubber gloves) when they were love-making on the floor and soapy water overflowed. When Sam went to a robot factory to get a replacement body for his girlfriend, his choices included Robby the Robot (from Forbidden Planet (1956) and Gort (from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)). Cherry 2000 In Susan Seidelman's PG-13 sci-fi comedic romance, John Malkovich played a dual role: emotionless, inept, grouchy, reclusive and nerdy android creator, a scientist named Dr. Jeff Peters a lifelike android 'Ulysses', created in Jeff's image and intended for solitary deep space research for seven years Comic confusion arose when the design company Chemtech Corporation's PR New Wave ""image consultant"" Frankie Stone (Ann Magnuson), who had promoted, packaged and 'sold' Ulysses (with a detachable, spinning head) to the American public, also taught the android about emotions, sensitivity and love. Frankie ultimately fell in love with the more evolved and sexually-satisfying male robot, when Ulysses switched roles with his creator.

Dog Owner's Guide: Canine feet Different paws for different dogs Introduction It's pretty obvious that a dog is a quadruped, a sure-footed, four-footed critter with specialized paws that help him get around the block, across the field, and off the sofa. What is not so obvious is just how special those paws really are. First, a bit of anatomy is in order. A dog walks on his toes like a horse, not the soles of his feet like a bear or a human. The dog's front limb assembly resembles the human arm with shoulder, upper arm, and forearm, but there the direct correlation ends. The human wrist is analogous to the canine pastern joint, the back of the hand is the dog's pastern, and the fingers form the dog's paws. In back, again the upper part of the dog's body parallels the human leg structure with upper thigh joined to hip at one end and knee at the other and lower thigh leading from knee to heel. The dog's heel doesn't touch the ground, however; it is represented by the hock joint and the human foot becomes the dog's rear pastern, and the human toes are his rear paws. The dog's paws provide both traction and shock absorption and come in handy for digging. Thick pads absorb more shock and increase endurance. Rough pads allow for better traction for quick turns and effective sprinting. Each foot has four pads on the ground, each with its own toenail. Some breeds also have dew claws, a fifth toe on the inside of the paw that doesn't touch the ground. Dew claws are generally left on the front feet, but usually removed on the hind feet as they can catch on obstacles and tear. Dew claws are removed when the pup is a few days old, before his nerves are completely active so he feels no pain.","The context explicitly states that some breeds have a fifth toe on the inside of the paw, referred to as a dew claw. This is the answer to the question.",20,1,1,1,1,1,0,8054,701,16.580960988998413,1112525787.0117188

What are the plastic bits at the end of shoelaces called? | Notes and Queries | guardian.co.uk SEMANTIC ENIGMAS What are the plastic bits at the end of shoelaces called? THE WORD is ""aglet"". A chemist at Berkeley has recently made a molecular version for stopping the ends of certain long intertwined molecules from fraying. Matthew Todd, University Chemical Laboratory, Cambridge. THIS is a classic example of the family of names for things you didn't know had a name (and probably didn't care). Others are the indent at the bottom of a wine bottle (a kick or a punt) and the wire contraption on table lamps that keeps the shade off the bulb (a harp). Learn these and impress your friends! Rob Shipway, London E17. THE SECONDARY purpose of an aglet is when purchasing a dictionary: if it doesn't include the word, then don't buy it. Another good word for this test is ferrule, the tip on the bottom of an umbrella. Robert Moye, London SE4. While 'aglet' may be a correct term for the plastic bits on the ends of shoelaces, spare a thought for Dr. Wolfgang FlÃ¼gle, of the University of Heidleberg in Germany. It was he who originally discovered that small piece of sheep's intestine, suitably cleaned and shrunk, was a perfect device to prevent his own laces from unravelling. This idea caught on, and the device became known as FlÃ¼glebinder (plural) (lit. 'FlÃ¼gle's ties') but the unfortunate academic failed to patent the idea, which was later pinched by the chap who name them 'aglets'.

Like shoes, shoelaces have been around for thousands of years, long before names of inventors were ever recorded. Having started as basic string or leather thongs with which primitive humans bound their foot coverings, they would have gradually evolved into the shoelaces that we know today, with no individual ever credited with their ""invention"". Urban Myth Warning! It is widely mis-reported that shoelaces were invented by Harvey Kennedy on 27th March 1790. This date is centuries after shoelaces were in common use and is clearly incorrect.

A: Almost all shoelace knots are designed to be tied with two hands, and anyone who has tried to tie them with one hand will realise that this is extremely difficult, if not impossible. Besides those who are physically missing an arm, hand or fingers, there are those who have suffered strokes or have been crippled by arthritis, as well as those who are temporarily disabled through injury or other restrictions. A few solutions exist on this site, including the One Handed Shoelace Knot and the One Handed Lacing . I've even created a video of how to tie my Ian Knot with one hand .

A: These are some of the most often requested lacing variations. Straight Lacing has been around for hundreds of years, whereas patterns using two or more colors of lace come and go with fashion trends. Many sneakers nowadays are supplied with spare laces in complementary colors, prompting many people to want to lace those sneakers using two or more colors. My extensive Shoe Lacing Methods and Bi-color Lacing Methods sections contain a number of the more popular examples, including Straight Bar Lacing (= Lydiard Lacing), Checkerboard Lacing and Double Lacing .

Q: How are the the extra eyelets at the top of shoes used? Q: How do you use the extra eyelets at the top of shoes? A: Some shoes, particularly running shoes, have an extra pair of eyelets at the top. Sometimes they are positioned a little further around the ankle (towards the heel). These extra eyelets can be used for Lock Lacing , which creates a type of ""winch"" that allows for extra tightening. This locks the heel securely and prevents heel slip and the associated blisters.

Q: How do you fix excessively short shoelaces? Q: How do you make shoelaces the correct length? A: It's rare for shoelaces to be the exact length; most seem to be excessively long nowadays. The best solution is to figure out the correct length , then either replace the shoelaces or shorten them yourself and replace the aglets . You may instead choose a different Lacing Method that matches the length of your existing shoelaces. There are methods suited to either longer or shorter laces. For long shoelaces, use a bulkier Shoelace Knot that consumes more lace, such as many people do with the Double Shoelace Knot . Any amount of excess lace can be used up with the Double Ian Knot , albeit with a ridiculous looking result! Q: What is a shoelace tip called? Q: What is a shoelace tip called?

Q: What is the name for the sleeves on the ends of shoelaces? A: The plastic or metal sleeves at the ends of shoelaces are called aglets (or ""aiglets""). Besides making an interesting trivia or crossword puzzle question, aglets have several functions: They prevent the ends of the shoelaces from fraying, they make it easier to hold the ends of the shoelaces when lacing, they make it easier to pass the shoelaces through the eyelets or lugs, they may also provide a colorful or decorative finish to the laces. The word ""aglet"" (or ""aiglet"") comes from Old French ""aguillette"" (or ""aiguillette""), which is the diminutive of ""aguille"" (or ""aiguille""), meaning ""needle"". This in turn comes from the original Latin word for needle: ""acus"". An ""aglet"" is thus like a small ""needle"" at the end of a shoelace. Note that the name ""aglet"" has also been given to a class of Java programs, and in that context is derived from the words ""agent"" & ""applet"", as described here: Aglet Manufacturing Processes Metal aglet process In the past, most aglets were made of metal, and were created by either rolling or crimping a small piece of metal directly onto the shoelace. Shoe repairers were able to supply and fit replacement aglets using a heavy duty crimping tool (as pictured at right). In recent years, metal aglets have seen a resurgence, bringing some ""bling"" back to shoelaces. These are usually attached in the factory by either gluing or crimping. Plastic tape aglet process Nowadays, most aglets are made of plastic, and are formed directly onto the raw shoelace using a large, expensive ""shoelace tipping"" machine (as pictured at right). A typical plastic aglet begins with acetate tape, twice the width of the required aglet, which is wound around a section of the uncut shoelace. Carefully controlled heat, and often a solvent such as acetone, is applied at the same time, which just melts the tape directly onto the shoelace as well as bonding the tape onto itself. When cooled, the shoelace is cut through the middle of the coated section, leaving half on each side of the cut. This single operation creates two aglets: One attached to the end of the cutoff section of shoelace, another attached to the start of the uncut section of shoelace. Molded tip aglet process For polyester shoelaces, there is also another totally different process where the end is clamped and heated ultrasonically, producing a solid molded tip from the actual shoelace material itself. Shoelaces with molded tip aglets are often used for high-stress applications such as ice hockey skates because they have no separate plastic or metal piece that can become damaged and fall off onto the ice. Related Links","The context explicitly mentions that the plastic bits on the end of shoelaces are called aglets. It states, ""An aglet (or aiglet) is the name given to the plastic or metal tip on the end of a shoelace."" Additionally, the answer provided in the context directly states, ""A: An aglet."" These references confirm that the correct term is ""aglet.""",52,1,1,1,1,1,0,15176,5525,122.29500484466553,1112525787.0117188

Anna Nicole Smith: Supreme Court rules Anna Nicole Smith daughter not entitled to estate - latimes
Supreme Court rejects Anna Nicole Smith case
Justices say her heir is not entitled to a share of her tycoon husband's estate.
June 24, 2011 |By David G. Savage, Washington Bureau
Former Playboy playmate Anna Nicole Smith married billionaire oil tycoon… (Splash News, Splash News )
Reporting from Washington — Former Playboy playmate Anna Nicole Smith's heir is not entitled to share in the $1.6-billion estate of her elderly Texas husband, the Supreme Court ruled, apparently ending a Dickensian legal struggle.
Because the battle over oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall II's wealth outlived most of the parties to the suits, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. compared it to ""Bleak House,"" Charles Dickens' novel about a lawsuit that never ends.
Vickie Lynn Marshall, who was better known as Anna Nicole Smith, married the 89-year-old billionaire a year before his death in 1995. Although he had given her many gifts and apparently promised many more, she was not included in his will.
She sued in Texas probate court, alleging that Marshall's son Pierce, a prime heir, had conspired to deny her as much as $400 million that her late husband had promised. That case went to trial, and she lost.
She filed separately for bankruptcy in Los Angeles. Pierce Marshall filed a claim against her in California bankruptcy court, accusing her of defaming him. She filed a counter-claim asserting that Pierce Marshall had schemed to deny her the money his father had promised, and won big. In 2000, the bankruptcy judge awarded her $475 million in damages, essentially the amount she had sought from the estate.
Since then, the case has been in the hands of appellate judges, seeking a ruling on which court had the authority to decide the matter: the state probate court in Texas or the federal bankruptcy court in California.
The case made several trips to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco as well as two trips to the Supreme Court.
Along the way, the damages were reduced to $88 million.
But the dispute came to an end Thursday. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled the bankruptcy judge had overplayed his hand and should not have awarded damages against Pierce Marshall. Roberts said the bankruptcy judge had the authority to resolve Smith's debts, but not to decide her claims against Marshall.
Eric Brunstad, a lawyer for the Marshall family, said the decision ""finally puts to rest years and years of litigation, and vindicates Pierce, who passed away five years ago this week.""
Smith died in 2007. Howard K. Stern, her former domestic partner, had carried on the case as executor of her estate. Her sole beneficiary is her daughter, Dannielynn Birkhead, who will be 5 in September. Smith's adult son, Daniel, died in 2006, days after Dannielynn's birth.
The case of Stern vs. Marshall may well live on in bankruptcy circles, since Roberts wrote a major opinion on the constitutional limits on bankruptcy judges.
Los Angeles lawyer Kent Richland, who argued the case for Stern, called the implications ""quite significant.""
Usually, bankruptcy judges seek to resolve all of the complicated side disputes involving a bankrupt person or company, but the chief justice said their authority did not extend to disputes under state law that could be handled in state court.

Sept 8 (Reuters) - Factbox on striker Wayne Rooney who set an all-time England scoring record of 50 goals in a Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland at Wembley Stadium on Tuesday. Born: Oct. 24, 1985 in Liverpool. CLUB CAREER: After coming through Everton 's youth academy, Rooney made his first-team debut as a 16-year-old against Tottenham Hotspur in August 2002. He scored his first Premier League goal for Everton on Oct.19 with a last minute match-winner against Arsenal, five days before his 17th birthday. Manchester United signed the 18-year-old for 25.6 million pounds ($39.42 million) in August 2004. He made his United debut on Sept.28 scoring a hat-trick in a 6-2 home win over Fenerbahce in the Champions League to become the youngest player to score a hat-trick in the competition, aged 18 years 335 days.
Rooney has won five Premier League titles, two League Cups and one Champions League with United. He was England's Footballer of the Year in 2010. Rooney was handed a five-year contract by David Moyes in February 2014 and given the captain's armband after Louis van Gaal took charge at Old Trafford ahead of the 2014-15 season. Rooney is third on United's record all-time scoring list with 233 goals in 485 appearances. He is 16 behind Bobby Charlton's record of 249. ENGLAND: Made his debut aged 17 years 111 days on Feb.12 2003, coming on as a halftime substitute in a 3-1 defeat to Australia at Upton Park to become England's then-youngest ever player, breaking a record that had stood since 1879.
Scored his first senior international goal in his sixth international on Sept.6 2003 against Macedonia in Skopje in England's 2-1 Euro 2004 qualifying win to become the country's youngest scorer at 17 years 317 days. Rooney scored four times in the Euro 2004 finals before England bowed out in the quarter-finals to Portugal. Almost missed the 2006 World Cup finals after suffering a foot injury two months before the tournament. Despite recovering in time, Rooney looked far from his best and failed to score against Trinidad & Tobago and Sweden before his tournament ended in misery after being sent off in the quarter-final defeat by Portugal. LACKLUSTRE PERFORMANCES: After England failed to qualify for Euro 2008, Rooney had to wait until the 2010 World Cup in South Africa to play in another major international tournament. However, the striker's lacklustre, goalless performances were criticised and England were eliminated in the second round. Rooney helped England secure their place at Euro 2012 but was sent off in their last qualifier against Montenegro and was banned for three matches, which was reduced to two on appeal. Missed England's opening two games of Euro 2012 against France and Sweden but scored on his return against Ukraine before England were knocked out on penalties in the quarter-finals by Italy. BECOMING CAPTAIN: Having endured two disappointing World Cup campaigns, Rooney was determined to make amends at last year's tournament in Brazil but he was played out of position in England's opening match against Italy. Rooney did score his first ever World Cup goal in England's 2-1 defeat by Uruguay before they were knocked out of the tournament without a win in the group stage. After England's poor World Cup showing, Steven Gerrard retired from international duty and relinquished the captaincy. Coach Roy Hodgson named Rooney as captain in August ahead of the start of England's Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. Rooney scores his 50th goal for England in 107 appearances with a penalty against Switzerland in a Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley and has overtaken Bobby Charlton's record of 49.

Football in Ecuador and other sporting activities
When it comes to local sports, the most popular activity is generally soccer (football). Tourists are often welcome to join in on local games, but remember that many of the locals play the game often and display quite impressive skill. Soccer in Ecuador is something of a national pastime and local soccer heroes are celebrated with enthusiasm. In fact, the national soccer team has made waves all over the world, with Ecuador displaying some outstanding soccer talent that perhaps some parts of the world were completely unprepared to receive. In Ecuador, soccer is so popular that it is considered to be the national sport. Sometimes you will find locals playing more unusual games such as the “paddleball” which is played in Ibarra. These two, can be joined in on, but it is a good idea to watch for a while first and learn the rules of the game. Many of the locals along the coast also enjoy a good game of volleyball.
Ecuador certainly has a wealth of sporting activities to partake in. Many of them require the hire of equipment or of a knowledgeable guide. You may also need someone to show you how to partake of the sport. You can be sure though, that any effort or expense is well worth it and that you will enjoy every moment of the activity you choose as it will be provided in a safe, well organized manner.
The most accessible activities are generally those that require very little equipment. Things such as walking, hiking and climbing – which is basically walking up to the peak of a mountain – are available just about everywhere in Ecuador. Of course, some of the more complex trails might require the services of a guide, but otherwise all you need is good health, a comfortable pair of shoes and a map. Sometimes tour operators will offer climbing tours wherein they will provide equipment, insurance, food and transport – basically all the facilities you will need to enjoy your climb in relative luxury. Most climbs take place up the sides of volcanoes to get you better acquainted with this natural phenomenon. Rainforest treks where you explore the fauna and flora of the Amazon basin are also popular.
Mountain bikes are readily available for hire throughout the country and often tourists will choose to bike between towns as this is an excellent way to really experience Ecuador. Water activities include swimming, whitewater rafting, snorkeling, kayaking, fishing, surfing, windsurfing and scuba diving – depending on what part of the country you are visiting. On the more extreme side of things, Bungee jumping, hang-gliding and Paragliding are also offered. Horseback riding and volleyball are two more popular choices. Mules and jeeps are available for hire as are yachts and rowing boats.
The Galapagos Islands themselves have a wealth of interesting activities to pursue, such as hiking, sea kayaking, snorkeling and scuba diving . The Galapagos Islands are part of a well protected nature reserve so it is best to remember to try not disturb any of the natural environment when visiting here. It is also a good idea to bring a camera or two – one for land and one for under water. There is such an abundance of wildlife here that you will not regret it.
If you are intent on pursuing any of these activities specifically, it would be prudent to ensure that they are being offered at your destination of the choice. Certainly one can see that there is a wealth of things to do in Ecuador and that if you so desire, your holiday can be as action packed as you want.

qz_2404,What is the scientific name given to tea?,Camellia Sinensis,"Tea's Scientific Name---The Basics
It's not uncommon for the common names of plants to vary from place to place and time period to time period.  This also holds true for tea plants (see Common Names:  What's in a Name? ).  A scientific name, on the other hand, is the same around the world.  So while North Americans call it tea and Russians call it chai, it Camellia sinensis in both places and everywhere in between.
Scientific names are important because they provide the means for growers and those in the scientific community to accurately reference and discuss the same plant.  Even if you're not a scientist, the one way to ensure you're getting the exact plant you want at your local nursery is to use its scientific name. 
Yes, scientific names are Latin.  Yes, they're standardized.  But don't let either of those things intimidate you.   If you know a few basics, they're also fun as you can start to puzzle out details of the plants they're naming.  Don't forget that English is full of words with Latin origins, so it's often logical to work out meanings.  The following is a very brief overview of scientific names as they relate to tea.  
Early Scientific Names for Tea
The first scientific mention of tea in the West came in 1712 when it was called Thea.  Thea came from t'e, the word used for tea in the Amoy dialect.  Then in 1753 Carl von Linné of Sweden (more commonly known as Linnaeus) included tea in his groundbreaking work, Species Plantarum.  Although he described tea plants in its pages, the work is best known for the simple and effective formula for naming plants that Linnaeus introduced in it to replace an extraordinarily cumbersome system.  In fact, the system he introduced is the one we still use today.
With his binomial (two names) system, every plant is assigned two latinized names that together uniquely identify it: a genus and a specific epithet that together comprise the species name.  For tea, Camellia is the plant's genus name, sinensis is its specific epithet, and the species is Camellia sinensis.  Explanations follow.","The context explicitly states that the scientific name for tea is Camellia sinensis, which is also confirmed by the detailed explanation of the binomial naming system and the history of the name's evolution. The answer is directly provided and supported by multiple sections of the context.",43,1,1,1,1,1,0,6374,673,16.714818716049194,1112525787.0117188

He is also the twin brother of Castor and the son of Zeus and Leda of Sparta, who was a mortal. He and Castor form the constellation Gemini. The twins were born from eggs after Zeus visited Leda as a swan. Since one parent was mortal and the other immortal, Castor became mortal whereas Polydeuces became immortal. Polydeuces was known as a boxer and won many Olympic events. He was also one of Jason's Argonauts on Jason's quest for the golden fleece. During the quest, Polydueces proved himself by killing an evil king and allowing the quest to continue. When the twins returned from the quest, they got in a dispute with two other men which was followed by a terrible battle. During this battle, Castor, the mortal, was killed. Polydeuces was terribly saddened by this and cried to his father Zeus. Zeus listened to Polydueces and decided to let Polydeuces and Castor spend alternate days on Olympus, home of the gods, and in the underworld. Zeus also raised the twins image to the sky forming the constellation Gemini or the twin stars. Article details: Castor and Polydeuces Castor and Polydeuces ... In Greek mythology , the Dioscuri ( Διόσκουροι )Castor (or Kastor) ( Κάστωρ ) and Polydeuces ( Πολυδεύκης )(sometimes called Pollux) were the twin sons of Leda and the brothers of Helen of Troy and Clytemnestra . They are known as the Gemini, Latin for twins. According to Liddell and Scott's Lexicon, kastor is Greek for ""beaver"", and poludeukeis means ""very sweet"". Castor (held by a giant) and Polydeuces from the Pergamon Zeus Altar They are called the Dioscuri (dios kouroi), meaning the ""Sons of Zeus "", although the story of their parentage is confused, as it is for their sisters Helen and Clytemnestra. The best known story is that Zeus disguised himself as a swan and seduced Leda. Thus Leda's children are frequently said to have hatched from two eggs that she then produced. By many accounts, however, Leda's mortal husband Tyndareus could also have fathered some of the children. Which children are thus mortal and which half-immortal is not consistent among accounts, nor is which children hatched from which egg. Castor and Polydeuces are sometimes both mortal, sometimes both divine. One consistent point is that if only one of them is immortal, it is Polydeuces. As a further complication, the Zeus swan story is sometimes associated with the goddess Nemesis. In this tradition, it was Nemesis who was seduced and who laid the egg, but the egg was then found by or given to Leda. However, this story is usually associated with Helen, not with Castor and Polydeuces. Polydeuces was a powerful boxer, and Castor a great horseman. In Roman mythology, Castor was venerated much more often than Polydeuces. He was known as Castore. When Theseus and Pirithous kidnapped their sister Helen and carried her off to Aphidnae, the twins rescued her and counter-abducted Theseus' mother, Aethra. They also accompanied Jason on the Argo; during the voyage, Polydeuces killed King Amycus in a boxing match. When Astydameia, queen of Iolcus, offended Peleus, the twins assisted him in ravaging her country.","The context explicitly states that Polydeuces is the twin brother of Castor. Multiple passages confirm this, such as ""Polydeuces is a figure in Greek mythology. He is also the twin brother of Castor..."" and ""the Dioscuri were the twin brothers Castor and Pollux (also called Polydeuces).""

Big Brother, the surreal centrepiece of this week's events, turned its overwhelmed winner, comedian Jack Dee, into a national sweetheart. Red Nose Day has become an institution, with this year's slogan of ""Say pants to Poverty"" adding another twist to the already bizarre spectacle of 4m plastic noses adorning British faces and cars yesterday in aid of the charity. During the Big Brother contestants' painfully public incarceration in a house full of cameras, Dee made several foiled escape attempts, managing to break free just long enough to give his wife Jane a hug. Last night, allowed to leave the house legitimately after being voted the winner by the viewing public, deadpan Dee finally showed emotion when he was greeted outside by Jane, hugging her tightly and planting a kiss on her lips. Earlier Keith Duffy, a member of the boy band Boyzone and one of the most jovial members of the house, left after being voted out. He embraced fellow housemates Claire Sweeney, the Brookside actress, and Dee before leaving to a rapturous reception from fans gathered in the rain outside. He shouted: ""I need a good drink."" The show has so far raised £500,000 for charity. The houses's first evictee, former boxer Chris Eubank, had been swiftly followed by a crestfallen Feltz, Anthea Turner, then Duffy and finally runner-up Sweeney. Despite sour grapes from ""nasty"" Nick Bateman, Big Brother's original celebrity, who dismissed the latest contestants as ""a bunch of desperate celebrities trying to advance dwindling careers"", the programme raised millions as the public phoned to vote for the latest evictees. Elsewhere, more than 150,000 fundraising events led up to yesterday's BBC television extravaganza, which also featured a long-awaited interview between Ali G and the Beckhams. Robbie Williams's personal belongings were auctioned and Billy Connolly performed one of his habitual streaks, this time around Eros in Piccadilly. It was only to be screened last night if television audiences raised £1m in an hour. A special edition of Harry Potter books looks set to raise up to £20m from worldwide sales. A total of £174m has been raised since Red Nose Day's inception in 1985. Then it was launched from a refugee camp in Sudan in 1985 as an attempt to relieve poverty in Africa. But more than a quarter of this year's money has come from commercial donors, turning Red Nose Day into a brand in its own right and posing questions about the spirit of the campaign. Earlier in the week BT was criticised for taking a hefty portion of money from people calling its Comic Relief premium rate line.

Celebrity Big Brother , the star-packed successor to the slice-of-life international TV hit is under way on Channel 4 . 2. The new manifestation of the show aims to raise money for Comic Relief and features six British celebrities who are scrapping it out over a week to be the last survivor by this Friday's Red Nose Day . 3. Boxer Chris Eubank, Brookside actress Claire Sweeney, Boyzone star Keith Duffy, comedian Jack Dee, and TV presenters Anthea Turner and Vanessa Feltz entered the house last Friday to live under the gaze of its 24 cameras. 4. The first evictee has already been chosen with Chris Eubank being given his marching orders in the viewers' poll on Saturday night, attracting more than 750,000 votes, with each telephone call raising 15.5p for the charity. 5. Anthea Turner was nominated alongside Eubank (the contestants secretly nominate each other and the two with the most nominations face a public poll) but escaped, with some help from her husband Grant Bovey , who has admitted running up a huge phone bill to help keep her in. 6. Eubank dished the dirt on Anthea afterwards, claiming she was ""fragile"" and upset by her negative public image. This was increased by mocking tabloid coverage of her wedding, which featured a tie-up deal with a glossy magazine and a chocolate manufacturer. 7. Meanwhile, Jack Dee has indicated he is less than enthralled at living in the UK's least private house and on Sunday tested out the night-vision cameras. As Sweeney and Duffy relaxed in the infamous hot tub, Dee was in the garden secretly digging a hole under a fence . He then spied an open gate but was quickly captured by security guards and frog-marched back. 8. Commentators have pointed out that the celebrities have been afforded more privacy in the reality TV show than their predecessors, and are living without the intrusion of 24-hour web cam coverage; instead, there are edited video clips available to internet viewers. 9. The nation was enthralled last year as 10 strangers, who started out as unknowns, lived together in the Big Brother house for nine weeks with one being evicted every week in an attempt to win the £70,000 prize money. 10. Craig Phillips won the cash and donated it to a young friend for vital surgery, but only after a blistering confrontation with 'Nasty' Nick Bateman , who had taken a very Machiavellian approach to winning at all costs . search_results.search_context[4]: | Comic Relief Red Nose Day 2001 Say Pants to Poverty Comic Relief raised a thwacking £61m in 2001. A total of £55 million was raised through the Red Nose Day 'Say Pants to Poverty' campaign itself, which saw great swathes of the public sport their pants with pride and £6 million was raised through the international sales of J.K. Rowling 's special Harry Potter books. Among the many telly treats there was Billy Connolly's naked streak around Piccadilly Circus, Jack Dee's victory in the celebrity Big Brother house and Ali G's interview with Posh and Becks.

He won the week-long fly-on-the-wall competition ahead of soap actress Claire Sweeney and Boyzone star Keith Duffy. Jack and Jane Dee walking from the house More than 3.2 million people phoned to vote during the week as Dee's deadpan humour made him the viewers' favourite. And 12.3 million tuned in to watch as Dee's wife Jane met him at the door of the house when he was finally released on Friday. The love-struck pair walked together in the pouring rain, fireworks exploding around them, to meet host Davina McCall. Dee won despite pleading with viewers to evict him earlier in the week. Viewers saw him ready to leave with his hat and coat on and case packed on Thursday and earlier on Friday. 'I need a drink' He did manage to escape briefly on Wednesday night to hug his wife Jane. He shouted ""I love you"" to her when he spotted her in the crowd outside. Pop star Keith Duffy was first to be evicted on Friday after coming third in the contest, and Sweeney - star of TV's Brookside - was runner-up. Sweeney: Runner-up in the celebrity contest The results were announced on BBC One's charity Comic Relief show after the contestants had been narrowed down to three on Wednesday. On being released from the house, Duffy said: ""I need a drink."" He described the best part of the week as sharing a bedroom with Dee. Almost �160,000 ($229,000) was raised through phone votes on Friday alone, taking the total raised for Comic Relief by Big Brother to over �500,000. Every phone call to nominate a housemate for eviction raises 15.5p for charities in Africa and the UK. Celebrity Insights Dee had been named by bookies as the overwhelming favourite to win. The show has gripped Britain over the last week after six celebrities were locked in the house and evicted one-by-one. The stress shown by celebrities including Vanessa Feltz and Anthea Turner gave the public a rare insight into the psyches of the famous. Duffy leaving the house with host Davina McCall Earlier on Friday, the celebrity housemates staged a country and western party and were presented with their final task - painting a picture. The group dressed up in fancy dress clothes for the party - including a huge, colourful dress for Sweeney and a cowboy hat for Dee. Dee had gone missing from the house on two occasions - once being led back inside by security guards. The comic tried every trick in the book to be voted out, even suggesting to viewers they should kick him out to see how the others would manage without him. Vanessa, meanwhile, has not seen the funny side of Big Brother at all. She said that she ""hardly survived the experience"" of living with five other celebrities.

Sir Donald Bradman
Sir Donald Bradman, who has died aged 92, was on any reference to averages by    far the greatest batsman who has ever lived; so marked, indeed, was his    pre-eminence that he became one of the great sporting legends of the 20th    century, standing forth not merely as a national hero in Australia, but as a    phenomenon for all the cricketing world to wonder at.
12:00AM GMT 27 Feb 2001
When The Don walked out to bat in his last Test match, at the Oval in 1948, his average in Tests was 101.39. Applauded all the way to the wicket, and given three cheers by the English team, he was then bowled for a duck second ball by a googly from Eric Hollies.
So Bradman ended with a Test batting average of 99.94 from 52 Tests, a surprisingly small number by modern standards. (Allan Border played in 156 Test matches between 1978 and 1994.) Bradman played 338 innings in first-class matches, and made 28,067 runs with an average of 95.14.
This total included 117 centuries, so that he scored a hundred slightly more than one in every three times he went out to bat. He would have made many more had he not lost so much of his prime to the Second World War. For more than eight years, between the Test at Headingley in July 1938 and the first at Brisbane in late 1946, he played no Test innings at all.
Among those batsmen who have completed their careers and played in more than 20 Test innings, the next best averages are those of Graeme Pollock, George Headley and Herbert Sutcliffe, who all finished with an average of 60, some 40 runs behind Bradman. It is difficult to think of any other field of endeavour in which the best is so much better than the merely excellent.
On the other hand, Bradman was never a particularly elegant player, nor a classically orthodox one. He was, after all, entirely self-taught, and had been brought up on concrete wickets covered with matting; he did not bat on a grass wicket until he was 18 (and then, of course, he made a century).

In these circumstances Bradman had developed an unusual grip, which he steadfastly refused to change. The right hand was twisted to the right so that as the palm gripped the handle it was facing nearly directly down the pitch. The left hand was turned so that its back faced the bowler.
As Bradman took up his stance the leading edge of the bat pointed almost towards the bowler, while its bottom rested between, not behind, his feet. He took the bat up at an angle of 45 degrees to the flight of the ball. This set-up made him particularly strong in the hook, the pull and the cut. He said his grip made it impossible to lift the hook shot unless he tried to; and he was equally safe with the cut. More extraordinarily, given his grip, he also developed an effective off-drive.
On the debit side, it was argued, the grip handicapped him on wet wickets where there was sharp turn. But then his footwork was so sprightly that he could usually smother spin.
It goes without saying that Bradman was quick and accurate in his judgment of length and speed, possessed the sharpest reflexes, and was gifted with perfect hand-eye co-ordination. But he was not alone in these qualities. What made him wholly exceptional were his inner confidence, his determination to dominate an attack, and his ability to sustain total concentration over a long innings.
Jim Laker used to tell how, at Lord's in 1948, he tied Bradman up for an over and was only prevented by the faintest edge from claiming him LBW. ""Well bowled, Jim,"" Bradman said at the end of the over. ""Thank goodness that's over. Now we can get on with some batting."" He hit the first ball of Laker's next over for four and was never in trouble again.
On strike, Bradman would be entirely still, not even tapping his bat. Often he was grinning - cynically, as many bowlers came to feel. ""As I ran up to bowl,"" Jim Laker has recorded, ""Bradman always seemed to know where the ball was going to pitch, what stroke he was going to play and how many runs he was going to score.""
Only at the start of an innings did Bradman appear vulnerable. Once he had settled, his instinct was not just to attack the bowling but to tear it to pieces. Scoring fast was almost as important to him as scoring high, and over his career he averaged 42 runs an hour. His dominance at the crease was the more remarkable as he was only 5ft 8in tall, and used a light bat.
No mercy was shown to tired or indifferent performers. ""He pitied none,"" wrote Learie Constantine, the great West Indian fast bowler. ""If he can make any bowler look foolish, he will do it."" And no matter what the heat, or the pressure, Bradman would always appear entirely cool, with not a drop of sweat.

SHOULD there be pressing need to fill a column – and, in truth, when has there ever been anything else? – addressing Sutton under Whitestonecliffe Women’s Institute may be among the more agreeable ways of accomplishing it.
It’s a pleasant village near Thirsk , England’s longest place name, so breath taking that the coal-fired pub merely calls itself the Whitestonecliffe Inn and has done.
Wikipedia hyphenates it, villagers disconnect. The world’s longest place name, adds Wiki, is an 85-letter job which translates from the Maori as something about the mountain where the bloke with big knees serenaded his lover on a nose flute.
Britain’s is that familiar railway station village on Anglesey – where, coincidentally, the country’s first WI branch opened in 1915.
In South Africa, 27 letters translates as “The Upper End of Cut Throat Valley”; in southern Australia a 26-character name means “Where the devil urinates”.
SUTTON SIGN: Visitors arrive simply to photograph the sign
Not least because nothing much else happens – the notice board revealed little other than that the parish council is concerned about Himalayan balsam, which may be an eastern cousin of Japanese knotweed – locals are quite proud of their name.
“People come just to photograph the road sign,” said Marany Rowley, the WI secretary.
Similarly to great lengths, the talk went well. The previous meeting attracted four members; this one had around 30: nice people, great spread.
The school, the shop and the chapel are long gone. The further bad news is that, after 92 years, Sutton under Whitestonecliffe Women’s Institute will also cease to exist after the next annual meeting. That’s the long and the short of it, alas.
BRIEFER but similarly sized, Bellerby is also in North Yorkshire, near Leyburn. Once it may have been best known for a road sign which warned “Slow ducks crossing.”
Now we learn that the delightful Dorothy Walker, who until five years ago wasn’t even Bellerby’s oldest resident, has died. She was 108.
We’d first met at the Methodist Church harvest festival in 2007, thereafter invited to her birthday parties – or, at least, to some of them.
Dorothy rarely made do with only one.
She came to Bellerby at 21, taught at the village school, met her husband at the village hall dance – Bellerby of the ball, no doubt – played the parish church organ for 74 years and ever enjoyed the Wensleydale Tournament of Song.
Until recently she lived independently, washed her own windows and at 99 won £150 and a supply of dog food – the dog food was never properly explained – in Take a Break magazine’s crossword competition.
The minister called, faithfully, every Monday. “He does the clues I can’t,” she said.
Beattie Tupling, whose presence in the village allowed the At Your Service column to describe Dorothy as “Bellerby’s junior senior citizen”, died in 2009, aged 103.
A year later, the classified obits reported the passing in Boroughbridge of Mrs Joan Mary Thistlethwaite. She was 104 – and “formerly of Bellerby”. Whatever it did to the ducks, there must clearly be something in the water.
ENGLAND’S longest singleword place name is reckoned to be Cottonshopeburnfoot, a hamlet off the A68 in Northumberland which by one letter beats its neighbour, Blakehopeburnhaugh, into second place.
We thought about going on Sunday, decided that such lengths couldn’t be justified, and fell instead to contemplating the North-East’s next-longest name.
It could be Newton-under-Roseberry, near Guisborough , but as it wasn’t the weather for climbing Roseberrry Topping we went to Middleton- in-Teesdale instead.
This is what might be termed the Lambton Worm School of Journalism – you know, roaming about to pick up bits of news – though the real excitement had come a few days earlier when a fierce garage fire led to a 200-yard exclusion zone around the blazing property.
Probably it was Middleton’s biggest fire since the 1970s when the old Cosy Cinema went up and two of the village’s retained fire brigade – aged about 75 and 67 – had to be summoned from the Over-60s club.
Though they performed heroically, the county council still reduced the maximum age to 55.
The day was dank, the village hardware shop still prominently displaying something called an auto-extending emergency snow shovel, lest things become bleaker yet. A chap with a step ladder was putting fairy lights on a tree, as if it wasn’t just the weather was November-ish, but that Christmas was coming apace.
Another shop had a card advertising a Lord of the Rings Lego set for £65, or an extra £20 if already assembled.
It seemed rather to defeat the object.

De Palma's best known, but not best Hitchcock homage. Style triumphs over substance but it's still good fun.
20 January 2003 | by Infofreak
(Perth, Australia) – See all my reviews
'Dressed To Kill' was Brian De Palma's third Hitchcockian thriller, and his most successful. I don't necessarily mean artistically successful, but it still remains one of his best known movies, and is the one on which his reputation as ""that Hitchcock"" guy mainly rests on. De Palma has made all kinds of movies in his long career but it says a lot for the impact 'Dressed To Kill' had on audiences for him to be stereotyped like that by many movie lovers. In 'Sisters' De Palma paid tribute to 'Rear Window', in his underrated 'Obsession' it was 'Vertigo', and this time around 'Psycho' is the major inspiration. Some critics of De Palma complain he is more interested in style over substance, and in 'Dressed To Kill' there is some truth in that. You will probably guess the murderer after the first 20-25 minutes, then think to yourself ""no, that's just a red herring and there will be an unexpected twist later on"". You might then be a bit let down when the your initial guess turns out to be correct after all, but there are enough thrills and dazzling sequences throughout to keep most thriller fans happy. Michael Caine and Angie Dickinson are both pretty good in their respective roles, but Nancy Allen ('RoboCop') gives the real outstanding performance in the picture. De Palma would subsequently give her another good role in 'Blow Out' opposite John Travolta. Also strong are Keith Gordon (who went on to star in John Carpenter's 'Christine') and Dennis Franz ('NYPD Blue') in supporting roles. Personally I don't think 'Dressed To Kill' is as good as 'Sisters', but I still think it's first rate exploitation thriller and definitely worth watching. Not De Palma's most interesting movie by a long shot, but still one of his most watchable.

history
The so-called House of Dunkeld, in Scottish Gaelic  Dùn Chailleann (meaning Fort of the Caledonii or of the Caledonians), is a historiographical and genealogical construct to illustrate the clear succession of Scottish kings  from 1034 to 1040 and from 1058 to 1290.
It is dynastically sort of a continuation to Cenél nGabráin of Dál Riata, ""race of Fergus"", as ""house"" an originally Celtic concept to express one of the two rivalling leader clans of early medieval Scotland, whose founding father is king Fergus Mor of Dalriada. This Ferguside royal clan had rivalled the crown (of Dalriada, then that of Alba) against the Cenél Loairn, the later House of Moray for the preceding four or more centuries. The Cenél nGabráin were represented by the so-called House of Alpin before Dunkeld.
Sir Iain Moncreiffe made the case that Crínán of Dunkeld actually belonged to a Scottish sept of Irish Cenél Conaill royal dynasty.[1] This of course would not exclude his descendants from also being a (female line) continuation of the Cenél nGabráin through Bethóc.
Genealogically the Dunkeld dynasty is based on Duncan I of Scotland being of a different agnatic clan to his predecessor and maternal grandfather Malcolm II of Scotland. However, sociohistorically, the reign of Duncan's son Malcolm III of Scotland, which happens to coincide with the start of the centuries-long period of strong influence from the southern neighbour, the Kingdom of England, has been seen as a more important place to start.

The second trial of Harvey Phillip Spector for the murder of Lana Clarkson was dominated by one phrase: ""I think I killed someone."" The 69-year-old record producer, creator of pop's ""wall of sound"", was said to have uttered that phrase as he emerged from his home in the small hours of Monday, 3 February 2003.
Behind him, slumped in a fake Louis XIV chair, lay the body of Clarkson, a 40-year-old actor he had met earlier that night when she was working at the House of Blues venue on the Sunset Strip
The full force of Los Angeles's celebrity crime armada descended: news helicopters hovered overhead, high-priced lawyers – celebrities in their own right – were summoned, news crews and the idly curious gathered to peer through the iron railings of Spector's home.
Spector, too, played the part, seeming to revel in a return to the spotlight. He provided other staples of the Hollywood justice story: the tirade on the steps of the courthouse, the elaborate and downright weird hairdo, the rococo attire, the trophy wife, the phalanx of bodyguards. ""She kissed the gun,"" he told one interviewer.
While the first trial was dominated by forensics and the finer points on how blood spatters, the rerun came down to an elaborate game of did he, didn't he, involving meditations on memory, suggestibility and English language proficiency.
At the centre of the dispute was Spector's stand-in chauffeur on the night of Clarkson's death, Adriano de Souza, a Brazilian student who proved an unflappable witness. Despite his occasional awkwardness with English, De Souza recounted how he had collected Spector for an evening out that had seen him visit a clutch of Hollywood haunts, Trader Vic's and Dan Tana's, imbibe a huge amount of alcohol – ""navy grog"", 150-proof tequila – and share his evening with two dates before ending at the House of Blues.
There, Spector met Clarkson, an actor whose role, far removed from the showbusiness recognition she craved, was to guard the VIP area. Initially she took the freakishly coiffed Spector for a woman, before being corrected by the management and told to treat him ""like gold"".
After some persuasion she agreed to go home with Spector for a nightcap, watching Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye in the back of the Mercedes S430 limousine driven by De Souza on the way to ""Phil Spector's Pyrenees castle"", a 33-room turreted mansion perched on a hill in the unprepossessing Los Angeles suburb of Alhambra. Two hours later, she was dead.
For the second trial, almost six years after Clarkson's death, Spector downsized. Gone was the retinue of heavies that had marched into court with him every day the first time around. He was accompanied by just one bodyguard, and his young wife, Rachelle. His legal team was reduced to a single lawyer, Doron Weinberg. Facing him was the same lead prosecutor from the first trial, Alan Jackson.
Without the theatrics of that trial, Weinberg's speciality was studied doubt. De Souza, he noted, had been through eight variations of the phrase ""I think I killed someone"" in recounting events to investigators. Surely that suggested sufficient doubt to acquit, Weinberg argued.","The context explicitly states that Phil Spector was convicted of the murder of Lana Clarkson in 2009. The text mentions that he was found guilty of second-degree murder on April 13, 2009, following a second trial.

qz_2977,Which architect was known as the Wizard of the Dome?,Buckminster Fuller,"Dome (architecture) I. Introduction. Dome (architecture), a roof or vault, usually hemispherical in form. Until the 19th century, domes were constructed of masonry ... Dome (architecture) Dome (architecture) I. Introduction Dome (architecture), a roof or vault, usually hemispherical in form. Until the 19th century, domes were constructed of masonry, of wood, or of combinations of the two, frequently reinforced with iron chains around the base to counteract the outward thrust of the structure. Since then, as industrial technology developed, domes have been constructed of cast iron, reinforced concrete, steel, aluminum, laminated wood, or plastic. II. Origins The dome seems to have developed as roofing for circular mud-brick huts in ancient Mesopotamia about 6000 years ago. In the 14th century BC the Mycenaean Greeks built tombs roofed with steep corbeled domes in the shape of pointed beehives (tholos tombs). Otherwise, the dome was not important in ancient Greek architecture. The Romans developed the masonry dome in its purest form, culminating in the Pantheon, a temple built (AD 118-128) by the emperor Hadrian. Set on a massive circular drum 6 m (20 ft) thick that conceals eight interlocked masonry piers, the coffered dome rises 43 m (142 ft) to form a perfect hemisphere on the interior, with a large oculus (eye) in its center to admit light. The use of domes was continued in the Early Christian period for relatively small circular structures such as mausoleums and baptisteries. A typical example is the Church of Santa Costanza (350?), Rome, originally the tomb of Constantia, daughter of the emperor Constantine the Great. Byzantine architects were far more inventive in their use of domes. In the Byzantine capital of Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), a succession of large domed churches reached its apogee in Hagia Sophia (Church of the Holy Wisdom), built (532-537) for the emperor Justinian I. Its shallow dome, 31 m (100 ft) wide and ringed with windows at its base, is supported on four pendentives (spherical triangles) backed by immense exterior piers and by a series of half-domes. After the fall (1453) of Constantinople to the Seljuk Turks, Hagia Sophia was converted to a mosque and became the model for a number of vast domed mosques built throughout the Ottoman Empire in subsequent centuries. Even before that, however, there was a long tradition of Islamic domed buildings (palaces, mosques, tombs, and baths); the Dome of the Rock (691) in Jerusalem is one of the earliest examples. Set on a pillared arcade, its double dome is of timber construction. Perhaps the most famous Islamic structure is the Taj Mahal in Agra, India, built (1632-1648) by the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his favorite wife. Its slightly bulbous white marble dome rises on a tall drum over a spacious equilateral building. III. Renaissance, Baroque, and Neoclassical Domes The first great Italian Renaissance dome was the majestic octagonal dome built (1420-1436) by the architect Filippo Brunelleschi for Florence Cathedral. The immense structure, 39 m (130 ft) in diameter and 91 m (300 ft) tall, is topped with a lantern 16 m (52 ft) high, and consists of an outer roof shielding an inner masonry shell. The 8 primary ribs and 16 secondary ribs form a tightly interlocked masonry cage. In Rome the rebuilding of Saint Peter's Basilica occupied several generations of Renaissance architects. A plan for a Greek-cross (equal-armed) church, with a monumental dome over the crossing, was finally begun (1546) under the supervision of Michelangelo. Its awesome multiribbed dome, 41.7 m (137 ft) in diameter, became the prototype for domes throughout the world. The most notable baroque domes in northern Europe were built in Paris and London. Jules Hardouin-Mansart built (1676-1706) the resplendent Church of Saint Louis des Invalides in Paris. Its dome (28 m/92 ft wide) is set on two unusually tall drums pierced with large windows that flood the interior with light. Sir Christopher Wren's noble dome for Saint Paul's Cathedral (1675-1711), London, incorporates a shallow inner dome, a conical masonry shell supporting the high lantern, and an outer lead-sheathed dome of timber.

qz_3023,Which well known couple live at Bagshot Park in Surrey?,The Earl and Countess of Wessex,"Bagshot Park is the current home of Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex and the Countess of Wessex. The village of Bagshot is in the North West corner of both the county of Surrey and the diocese of Guildford. It is situated on the A30 (London to Southampton and the South West of England) where this is crossed by the Guildford to Reading road. The M3 motorway forms Bagshot's southern boundary and the village is immediately adjacent to junction 3. The neighbouring villages are: Windlesham, Sunningdale and Chobham to the east, Lightwater and Bisley to the south, and Frimley to the south west. Local towns are Camberley some 5 miles (8 km) to the south-west, Bracknell about 5 miles (8km) north-east, Windsor 10 miles (16 km) north, Woking 8 miles (13 km) south east and the Cathedral town of Guildford 12 miles (20 km) south. London Heathrow airport is about 15 miles (24 km) drive. Bagshot is on the outer edge of the 'green belt' (an area surrounding London in which development is restricted in order to contain the urban spread), the natural vegetation of the area is heath land (from which the administrative borough of Surrey Heath derives its name). The village is separated from its neighbours by open land, most of it heath. Much of this surrounding land is owned by the Ministry of Defence, and some is Royal Estate. The village is compact and the housing extends over less than 2 miles (3 km). Bagshot is of Saxon origin, originally in a parish with Windlesham. Coaching inns were the major reason for Bagshot's original prosperity (the village is on the main road from London to the West Country), together with a Royal hunting lodge favoured by the Stuart kings (now known as Bagshot Park and which is again a Royal residence with its occupation by Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex).","The context explicitly states that Bagshot Park is the current home of Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex and the Countess of Wessex.

Gjetost cheese, pronounced ""YAY-toast"" by Americans or ""yed-OOST"" by Scandinavians, is also known as Brunost cheese. Gjetost is a brown Norwegian cheese made of goat's milk or a blend of goat and cow's milk. Gjetost Cheese from Norway is produced by slowly heating a vat of whey, cream and milk. This is why Gjetost is sometimes called a whey cheese.  The caramel brown color of Gjetost Cheese is a result of the caramelization of the milk's sugars during this heating process.
Gjetost Cheese History
Gjetost Cheese originated in the Gudbrandsdalen valley of Norway over one hundred years ago. Gjetost has always been sweet like butterscotch with a dense, rich texture.  Gjetost is formed into rindless squares or cylinders, and is best when sliced wafer thin and enjoyed open-faced on Norwegian flatbread served with fresh fruit.  It is no wonder children are drawn the taste of this unique, sweet-like-fudge cheese.  Often enjoyed as a breakfast cheese in Norway, Gjetost also makes an excellent snack and is the perfect dessert cheese.
This unique Norwegian brown cheese is also known as Brunost, which is simply Norwegian for Brown Cheese. The Ski Queen variety is a blend of cow and goat's milk, whereas the Ekte Gjetost Cheese from Norway is made from 100% goat's milk.  Gjetost is packed with energy and is extremely tolerant of temperature fluctuations. Because of these benefits, Gjetost is a preferred snack for Norwegians skiiers, who pack it in their backpacks and snack on it while on the trails. This is where the Ski Queen brand name comes from, and may be one of the secrets to the international success of Norwegian cross-country skiiers.

Pronounced ""Yay-toast."" It's Norwegian, and although the name translates directly to ""goat cheese,"" chances are that this cheese tastes just about as far from any you've had before. Gjetost is as sweet as caramel, with the texture of a dense, buttery fudge.
Gjetost is a variety of Scandinavian brown cheese (brunost), often refered to as Ski cheese or Ski Queen.
Like ricotta, Gjetost comes from whey-- that is, the liquid by-product of cheesemaking. But while ricotta is fresh, ready in a matter of minutes, Gjetost is a time-consuming process which requires slow and continuous heating of whey, cream, and milk. Over many hours, the milk sugars are cooked to the point of caramelization. Its colour and unique taste are the product of the natural caramelization of the sugar in milk (lactose) that occurs during the cheese's production process. Gjetost is a concentrated, sweet block that tastes more like butterscotch than like actual cheese.
The thick but almost spreadable consistency of Gjetost lends itself well to anything crisp and crunchy, be it crackers, toasted bread, or thinly sliced apples and pears.

Youngberry is a complex hybrid between three different species from the genus Rubus, the raspberries, blackberries, and dewberries of the rose family. The berries of the plant are eaten fresh or used to make juice, jam, etc. Byrnes M. Young, a businessman in Morgan City, Louisiana, who loved science and plants, had an ongoing correspondence with Luther Burbank, who had created the 'Phenomenal' blackberry–raspberry hybrid. While he had no success growing either loganberries or 'Phenomenal' berries, Young crossed the 'Phenomenal' with the Austin-Mayes dewberry that was better adapted to his area. This produced ‘Youngberry’ in 1905, which was then released in 1926.","The context explicitly states that a youngberry is a cross between a blackberry and a dewberry.

Weather forecasters are warning us that tomorrow's storm could be the worst for decades .
And the fact that it has been named after St Jude - the patron saint of lost causes - isn't exactly reassuring.
We've been told to expect winds of up to 90mph, torrential rain, travel chaos and possible disruptions to the power supply , so perhaps we should start to despair.
But Monday also happens to be the feast day for this particular saint, so it might not be all bad news.
So who was St Jude? Here are the 10 things you need to know about the patron saint of lost causes and desperate cases...
1. St Jude was one of Jesus' 12 apostles, chosen to spread the word of the gospel.
2. He was also known as Thaddeus or Thaddaeus - said to be a surname for the name Labbaeus which means ""heart"" or courageous"".
3. He is believed to have written the book of Jude. Religious scholars say it contains some of the finest expressions of praise to God in the Bible's New Testament.
4. Jude became associated with desperate situations because of a letter he wrote to the Churches of the East. In it he says that the faithful must keep going even in harsh or difficult circumstances.
5. He is thought to have been martyred in Beirut in around 65 AD, along with fellow apostle Simon the Zealot. He is often depicted showing a club or axe, symbolising the way he died.
6. He is also sometimes pictured with a flame above his head. This refers to the Pentecost, where he and the other apostles received the Holy Spirit.
7. The personal ads sections of some newspapers occasionally include messages from people calling on St Jude for help in times of need, or thanking him for his support and guidance.
8. Some choose to carry the image of St Jude on a medal or as a pendant on a necklace to provide comfort.
9. The Shrine of St Jude can be found at the parish church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Faversham, Kent. It was set up in the 1950s by the church's friars, who noticed they were getting an increasing number of requests for St Jude prayer cards. Donations to ""The Shrine of St Jude"" began to come in, but one didn't exist - so Friar Elias Lynch set one up. The shrine is visited all year round, but particularly on St Jude's feast day - October 28.
10. St Jude is not to be confused with Judas Iscariot - another of the 12 apostles, but the one who betrayed Jesus.

Dressed in green and white Biblical-era clothing -- for he was one of the Disciples of Jesus -- he is distinguished by the fact that he often wears and holds a golden metal pendant of the type carried by people seeking his aid. Additionally, in some images of Saint Jude, there is a small flame atop his head, signifying the Baptism by Fire (also known as the Baptism of the Holy Ghost) which was received by the Disciples of Jesus at Pentecost.

BBC ON THIS DAY | 15 | 1997: Versace murdered on his doorstep 1997: Versace murdered on his doorstep Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace has been shot dead on the steps of his Miami mansion. The incident happened shortly before 0900 local time (1400 GMT) as the 50-year-old designer returned from the fashionable News Caf� where he bought breakfast and Italian newspapers. Witnesses described a white man in his mid-twenties taking a gun from a backpack and shooting Versace twice in the back of the head as he unlocked the gates to his Ocean Drive home. A gun was found with discarded clothes in a red Chevrolet pick-up truck abandoned in a car park. Prime suspect Police have traced the weapon to Andrew Cunanan, 27, a gay prostitute with an ""affluent clientele"". He is already on the FBI's most wanted list in connection with four other murders - all of the victims were, like Versace, homosexual. Miami police chief Richard Barreto described Cunanan as the sole suspect, but he did not know if he had any relationship with Versace. Hundreds of people have gathered opposite Versace's three-storey, Mediterranean style home, the only residential building in the art deco section of Ocean Drive. Police have sealed off the area round the blood-stained steps to the house - Casa Casuarina - where Versace lived most of the time with his friend Antonio D'Amico. Around the world Versace's stores have been closing as they received news of the tragedy. Tributes are pouring in from the many rich and famous friends who enjoyed wearing Versace's flamboyant designs. Amongst them Princess Diana has issued a statement saying she was ""devastated at the loss of a great and talented man"". Versace had just released his new winter collection and a glamorous television launch planned for the Spanish Steps in Rome has been cancelled. With the help of his sister Donatella and his brother Santo, Versace transformed the family firm into a multimillion-dollar fashion empire.","The context explicitly mentions that Gianni Versace was shot dead on the steps of his Miami mansion in 1997.

Quotes on Madonna and Guy's Marriage:
Guy: ""By the way, I enjoyed my first marriage. It's definitely not something I regret. The experience was ultimately very positive. I love the kids that came out of it, and I could see no other route to take. But you move on, don't you? You're right, I stepped into a soap opera, and I lived in it for quite a long period of my life. I'll probably be more eloquent on it 10 years from now.""

Updated November 14, 2016
Insulin has a hand in several processes in your body: Not only does it assist with metabolizing carbohydrates and storing glucose for energy in cells, but it also helps utilize the fat, protein, and certain minerals you eat. Because this hormone is so important in helping your body use the foods you ingest, a problem with insulin can have widespread effects on all of your body's systems, tissues, and organs—either directly or indirectly.
If you have type 2 diabetes, learning how insulin works can help you understand why so many other medical conditions are associated with diabetes, why certain lifestyle practices are beneficial, and how your body reacts to food.
Where Insulin is Produced in the Body
Insulin is a hormone made up of a small polypeptide protein that is secreted by the pancreas, which acts as both an endocrine and exocrine gland. Endocrine glands are the system of glands that secrete hormones to regulate body functions. Exocrine glands aid in digestion.
The pancreas sits behind the stomach, nestled in the curve of the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine), and contains clusters of cells called islets of Langerhans. Islets are made up of beta cells, which produce and release insulin into the bloodstream.
Insulin is Part of a Balancing Act
Insulin affects carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism. Your body breaks these nutrients down into sugar molecules, amino acid molecules, and lipid molecules, respectively.
The body can also store and reassemble these molecules into more complex forms. Insulin causes the storage of these nutrients, while another pancreatic hormone called glucagon releases them from storage.
Insulin is involved in your body's careful balancing act to keep your blood sugar levels within a normal range.
In simple terms:
If your blood sugar is high: The pancreas releases insulin to help cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream to lower blood sugar levels.
If your blood sugar is low: The pancreas releases glucagon to help the liver release stored glucose into the bloodstream to raise blood sugar levels.
Blood sugar levels rise when most foods are consumed, but they rise more rapidly and drastically with carbohydrates. The digestive system releases glucose from foods and the glucose molecules are absorbed into the bloodstream. The rising glucose levels signal the pancreas to secrete insulin to clear out glucose from the bloodstream. Insulin binds with insulin receptors on cell surfaces and acts as a key to open up the cells to receive glucose. Insulin receptors are on almost all tissues, including muscle cells and fat cells.
Insulin receptors have two main components—the exterior and interior portions. The exterior portion extends outside the cell and binds with insulin. When this happens, the interior part of the receptor sends out a signal inside the cell for glucose transporters to mobilize to the surface and receive glucose.
As blood sugar and insulin levels decrease, the receptors empty and the glucose transporters go back into the cell.
Insulin and Type 2 Diabetes
In a perfect situation, glucose from carbohydrates gets cleared rapidly. However, when there is insulin resistance , this does not happen, and sustained high glucose levels become a problem. Insulin resistance can be due to a problem with the shape of the insulin (preventing receptor binding), not having enough insulin receptors, signaling problems, or glucose transporters not working properly. Whatever the specific cause, the function of insulin is impaired.","The context explicitly states that the pancreas produces insulin, specifically mentioning that beta cells in the islets of Langerhans secrete insulin into the bloodstream. Multiple passages confirm this, such as ""Insulin is a hormone made up of a small polypeptide protein that is secreted by the pancreas"" and ""The pancreas produces insulin and other hormones.""",57,1,1,1,1,1,0,27944,1231,33.47622084617615,1124813775.2929688

Mrs. Merton : [interviewing Debbie McGee - Mrs Paul Daniels] What was it that first attracted you to millionaire Paul Daniels?
(Isle Of Bute , Scotland) – See all my reviews
This is a spoof chat show with Caroline Ahearne playing OAP Mrs Merton . The concept is that Mrs Merton will invite celebrities who are in on the joke onto the show and ask them cheeky questions :
To lorraine Kelly : "" What plans do you have for the menopause ? ""
To Debbie McGee : "" What attracted you to the millonaire Paul Daniels ""
I've no idea if anyone phoned up to complain about Mrs Merton asking these type of personal questions ( Spoof chat show KNOWING ME KNOWING YOU did receive a barrage of complaints about the presenter Alan Partridge ! ) but one edition did feature a record number of complaints about one of its guests Bernard Manning
For those who don't know Bernard Manning is an old hat working mans club comedian . The reason he's rarely seen is because
a ) He wasn't all that funny to start with
b ) His jokes usually involve outrageous racist comments
So maybe he wasn't the greatest guest to have on in the first place , I mean it's not like he was going to go down well on a light hearted spoof chat show . He was seated next to the previous guest Richard Wilson and they both got into a heated argument with Manning making comments about Asians during the war and stating that because some people might have been born in England this in no way makes them English

Her routine and style set the new standard for the sport. . At 15 years, 10 months, Henie was the youngest woman ever to win a gold medal. She held that title for 70 years, until American figure skater Tara Lipinski , two months younger than Henie, won gold at the 1998 Nagano Games . After the 1928 Games Henie went on to successfully defend her gold medal at the 1932 Winter Games and the 1936 Winter Games . Ambitious as ever, Henie aimed to take her skating career in a new direction—Hollywood. She said she wanted to do what Fred Astaire was doing in the movies, only on skates. She turned professional after the 1936 Games and by the end of the year saw the release of her first movie, One in a Million. That film was the first of a dozen films Henie would star in over the next two decades. She also began to gain fame by starring in a wildly popular traveling ice-skating show. Her Hollywood Ice Review was a spectacle of costumes, music, and skating that toured the world until the early 1950s. She died of complications from leukemia in 1969. Today, more than three-quarters of a century after her Olympic debut, Henie's accomplishments have retained their luster.

History
Skeleton racing involves plummeting head-first down a steep and treacherous ice track on a tiny sled. It is considered the world's first sliding sport.
 
Thrill-seeking tourists
Sleighing is one of the oldest winter sports. Descriptions of the sport can be found in 16th-century literature, but as a racing sport it can be traced to the mid-19th century, when British tourists started sliding down snowbound roads in the Alps. British and American holidaymakers built the first toboggan run in Davos in 1882.
The Cresta run
Skeleton sled racing owes it entire early history to St Moritz and the famed Cresta Run. The sport developed in the Swiss resort town as a pursuit for the rich. E. F. Benson put it best when he wrote in 1913, “There is one Mecca, there is one St Peter's, and there is one Cresta.”
Olympic history
Men’s skeleton made two early appearances on the Olympic programme at its “ancestral” home of St. Moritz in 1928 and 1948. It was then dropped until it reappeared as a men’s and women’s event at Salt Lake City in 2002.

Overview
The world returned to Winter Olympia after an enforced absence of 12 years.  St. Moritz was chosen because all of the sites that they had used in 1928 were still available and the Swiss resort could organize the Games much quicker than any other city, with the possible exception of Germany's 1936 site, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, which was not even considered.  In fact, Germany and its Axis partner, Japan, were not invited to the Olympic Games in 1948 in either St. Moritz or London.

Another small political protest occurred when Lebanon, the only Arab state entered, protested the entry of a Palestine team, which actually represented the nascent Jewish state, was composed of an all-Jewish team, and planned on carrying a Zionist flag.  Fortunately, the Palestine team withdrew because the team did not have adequate time to prepare.
St. Moritz hurriedly put together excellent arrangements for the Games that were again disturbed, though less severely, by the Föhn.  This time ice hockey matches (held outdoors) and the 10,000 metres speed skating had to be delayed but no events were cancelled this time, as they had been in 1928.
Alpine skiing made its true Olympic début.  A combined event had been held in 1936 but this time there were three events for both men and women.  Two athletes won a second ""St. Moritz"" Olympic medal, as [""Bibi"" Torriani] played on the Swiss ice hockey team to match his bronze from 1928; and [Jack Heaton] (USA) also repeated his silver medal from the [skeleton race in 1928] on the famed Cresta Run.  The skeleton race, a form of tobogganing unique to the St. Moritz resort, was held at the Olympics for only the second time, and some thought, last time.  But skeleton was restored to the Olympic Program and returned to the Olympics in 2002 at Salt Lake City.","The context explicitly states that the Cresta Run is located in St. Moritz and hosted the skeleton events for the 1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics.

Wireworms live in rotten wood or in the ground and feed on roots and seeds, injuring potatoes, grasses, and a wide variety of leguminous field crops. They live for 2 to 10 years before pupating in the ground or in wood. Methods of control include letting the land lie fallow, rotating crops, and special methods of cultivation.

Old wireworm damage (left) and fresh damage (right) on sweetpotato storage roots. General information True and false wireworms are the larval stages of two types of beetles. The adults of true wireworms are commonly called click beetles while the adults of false wireworms are known as darkling beetles. There are 667 different species of true wireworms found in Australia. BSES entomologists identified 26 species of true wireworm in established cane fields in north, central and southern Queensland and in New South Wales. Scientific name True wireworms of recorded agronomic importance in Australia include potato wireworm (Hapatesus hirtus) and sugarcane wireworm (Agrypnus variabilis). False wireworms are major soil insect pests of establishing summer and winter crops in Queensland and New South Wales. False wireworms of agronomic importance in Australia include northern false wireworm (Gonocephalum carpentariae),           southern false wireworm (Gonocephalum macleayi), small false wireworm (Gonocephalum misellum), eastern false wireworm (Pterohelaeus darlingensis) and striate false wireworm (Pterohelaeus alternatus). Life history The lifecycle of true wireworms varies greatly between species. For example, sugarcane wireworm takes one year with four larval instars to complete its cycle whilst the potato wireworm takes approximately four years with 10 larval instars. Summary of the lifecycle of the sugarcane wireworm (a true wireworm): Beetles emerge in October-November and migrate if habitat is not suitable. Female beetles require food (green leaf material) before they begin egg laying. Females lay eggs in November-February in batches of approximately 10 to 15 eggs. Eggs are laid on soil surface or           in small crevices. Once larvae have emerged they generally remain in the top 50 mm of the soil profile during the first instar stage. Later larval instars will move deeper in the soil profile in response to moisture and temperature. Sugarcane wireworm take ten months and four instars for larvae to fully develop in SE           Queensland. Once larvae mature (in September-October) they hollow out small soil cells to pupate within. This stage generally takes about two weeks. The lifecycles of the major false wireworm pest species are all similar: In central Queensland beetles emerge in October-January and migrate if the habitat is not suitable. Female beetles require food (green leaf material) before they begin egg laying. One month after emergence the females begin laying eggs on           the soil surface or just below. Egg laying may continue for up to 20 weeks but is terminated by cool weather. Females are capable of laying 1000 eggs or more. Once larvae have emerged they generally remain in the top 50 mm of the soil profile and are relatively immobile. Larvae develop through autumn, winter and spring. It is not possible to distinguish between larvae instars. They are believed to have up to 11 instars.","The context explicitly states that true and false wireworms are the larval stages of two types of beetles.
